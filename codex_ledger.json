PORTFOLIO SERVICES (portfolio/services.py): get_portfolio_holdings(), get_stock_price(), get_stock_metadata(), compute_portfolio_value() (total value + detailed breakdown with gain/loss), compute_allocations() (weight percentages per holding), compute_sector_breakdown() (sector allocation map), compute_portfolio_summary() (comprehensive metrics: total_value, num_holdings, largest_position, sector_breakdown, holdings list), estimate_portfolio_volatility() (low/medium/high classification based on diversification), get_ai_portfolio_insights() (AI analysis integration), get_portfolio_trades() (trade history retrieval), calculate_trade_metrics() (buy/sell counts, fees totals). STOCK SERVICES (stocks/services.py): get_stock_price(), get_stock_metadata() (ticker, name, sector, price, market_cap, P/E), get_stock_fundamentals() (revenue/income trends, debt, margins), get_recent_alerts() (date-filtered alerts), get_stock_volatility() (latest volatility score), get_ai_stock_analysis() (AI integration with risk profile), screen_stocks_by_sector(), screen_stocks_by_criteria() (price/sector/market cap/P/E filters), get_top_alerts() (high-volatility alerts), get_day_trade_candidates() (AI-powered trading ideas). ROUTE REFACTORING: portfolio/routes.py now uses service functions (analyze endpoint simplified, trades endpoint enhanced with metrics), stocks/routes.py refactored (detail/analyze/alerts endpoints use service layer, new day-trade-ideas endpoint added). DESIGN BENEFITS: Separation of concerns (routes handle HTTP, services handle logic), reusability (services called from multiple routes/tasks), testability (pure functions easier to unit test), maintainability (business logic centralized), consistency (single source of truth for calculations). PLACEHOLDER PATTERNS: AI integration points marked with TODO comments ('Replace with actual AI API call'), volatility estimation uses diversification proxy until proper calculation added, all numerical conversions handled safely (float() wrapping with None checks). SERVICE CONTRACTS: Functions return dicts/lists for JSON serialization, consistent error handling (empty data structures for missing holdings), decimal conversion to float for JSON compatibility, metadata functions include all required fields. INTEGRATION READY: Services prepared for OpenAI/Anthropic API calls (input_data structures built, prompt_template loaded), email automation tasks can call service functions directly, admin dashboards can leverage service metrics without duplicating logic. Stored in investment_app/portfolio/services.py and investment_app/stocks/services.py. Routes refactored to use service layer imports. Completes Flask application architecture with proper MVC separation: Models (database) \u2192 Services (business logic) \u2192 Routes (HTTP handlers) \u2192 Templates (presentation). Next steps: Add unit tests for service functions, implement actual AI API calls replacing placeholders, create admin dashboard leveraging service metrics."

      "content": "External stock market API integration added to stocks/services.py for real-time data and hybrid database/API architecture. HYBRID DATA STRATEGY: get_stock_price(ticker, use_api=False) checks database first, falls back to API if use_api=True or database empty, supports environment-based configuration (STOCK_API_PROVIDER: database/polygon/alphavantage). get_stock_metadata(ticker, use_api=False) returns complete metadata (ticker, name, sector, price, market_cap, P/E), queries database by default, API fallback with provider detection. API CLIENT MODULE (stocks/api_clients.py): StockAPIClient base class with abstract methods (get_price, get_metadata), PolygonClient class (last_trade endpoint for price, reference/tickers for metadata, aggregates for historical data), AlphaVantageClient class (GLOBAL_QUOTE for price, OVERVIEW for metadata including dividend yield, TIME_SERIES_DAILY for historical), get_api_client() factory function (returns configured client based on provider), fetch_from_api() convenience function (combines price + metadata in single call). POLYGON.IO INTEGRATION: API base URL https://api.polygon.io/v3, endpoints: /last_trade/{ticker} (current price), /reference/tickers/{ticker} (company details), /aggs/ticker/{ticker}/range (historical aggregates), returns sector via sic_description field, market_cap directly available, timeout 5 seconds with exception handling. ALPHA VANTAGE INTEGRATION: API base URL https://www.alphavantage.co/query, functions: GLOBAL_QUOTE (real-time price), OVERVIEW (company fundamentals with P/E, dividend yield, description), TIME_SERIES_DAILY (historical prices with compact/full options), outputsize parameter (compact=100 days, full=20+ years), returns structured time series data. CONFIGURATION: Environment variables STOCK_API_KEY (API key), STOCK_API_PROVIDER (database/polygon/alphavantage), config.py updated with STOCK_API_KEY and STOCK_API_PROVIDER settings, defaults to 'database' mode (no external calls), enable API mode by setting provider + key. ERROR HANDLING: Try-except blocks wrap all API calls, timeouts prevent hanging requests (5 seconds), print debug messages on errors, graceful fallback to database or default values, None returns indicate API failures. USE CASES: Real-time price updates (use_api=True forces fresh data), Portfolio valuation with live prices, Stock screener with current market data, Day-trade candidates need real-time signals, Development/testing uses database (free), Production can toggle API (paid service). COST OPTIMIZATION: Database-first strategy minimizes API calls, API only when explicitly requested or database empty, batch operations use database queries, individual stock analysis can use API for accuracy, caching layer possible (Redis for API responses). AI ANALYSIS ENHANCEMENT: get_ai_stock_analysis() updated to accept use_api parameter, metadata retrieved from API when needed, fundamentals still from database (requires separate integration), combined database fundamentals + API market data, comprehensive input for AI prompt generation. REQUIREMENTS: requests library (already in requirements.txt), STOCK_API_KEY environment variable, STOCK_API_PROVIDER environment variable, API account with Polygon.io or Alpha Vantage, optional: openai/anthropic libraries commented in requirements. TESTING PATTERNS: Mock API responses in unit tests, Test database fallback when API fails, Verify timeout handling, Test with missing API keys (should default to database), Integration tests with real API (rate limit aware). Stored in investment_app/stocks/services.py (updated) and investment_app/stocks/api_clients.py (new). config.py updated with API settings. Enables hybrid architecture: Free development with database, Production real-time data with API, Fallback resilience if API unavailable, Cost control through database-first strategy. Next steps: Add caching layer (Redis) for API responses, Implement batch price updates via scheduled task, Create admin endpoint to sync database from API, Add rate limiting for API calls."

      "content": "Comprehensive API key security system implemented to prevent credential exposure in version control and public repositories. CRITICAL SECURITY PRINCIPLES: NEVER commit API keys to GitHub (scraped by bots within minutes, leads to unauthorized charges and account suspension), NEVER hardcode keys in source files (any file in git is potentially public), ALWAYS use environment variables or secrets managers (separate credentials from code), ALWAYS use .gitignore for .env files (prevent accidental commits), ALWAYS rotate keys if exposed (delete compromised, create new immediately). SAFE STORAGE METHODS: Environment variables (temporary session: $env:OPENAI_API_KEY='sk-...' in PowerShell or export in bash, permanent system: Windows Environment Variables or ~/.bashrc/~/.zshrc), .env file (local development only with .gitignore protection, investment_app/.env created with placeholder, python-dotenv loads automatically in app.py), GitHub Secrets (for CI/CD workflows: Repository Settings \u2192 Secrets \u2192 Actions, use with ${{ secrets.OPENAI_API_KEY }} in YAML, never exposed in logs), Cloud platform secrets (Azure: az webapp config appsettings set, Heroku: heroku config:set, AWS: Secrets Manager or Parameter Store). FILES CREATED: investment_app/.env (local configuration file with placeholder keys, includes warnings to replace with actual keys, protected by .gitignore, contains OpenAI, Anthropic, database, email configs), API_KEY_SECURITY.md (comprehensive security guide with safe patterns, dangerous anti-patterns, emergency procedures if key exposed, platform-specific instructions for Azure/Heroku/AWS, testing and validation procedures). GITIGNORE PROTECTION ENHANCED: Added investment_app/.env and variants (.env.local, .env.*.local, .env.production, .env.development), Added instance/ directory (Flask instance folder for runtime secrets), Added *.db, *.sqlite, *.log files (prevent data exposure), Verified root .env already protected. SAFE CODE PATTERNS: Load from environment (import os; API_KEY = os.environ.get('OPENAI_API_KEY')), Use python-dotenv (from dotenv import load_dotenv; load_dotenv()), Validate without exposing (print(f'Key: {key[:7]}...{key[-4:]}')), Fail safely (if not API_KEY: raise ValueError('Key not set')). DANGEROUS ANTI-PATTERNS (NEVER DO): Hardcode in source (OPENAI_API_KEY = 'sk-proj-abc123'), Commit .env files (git add .env), Put in config.py with real values, Include in README or docs, Log full keys in application logs. VALIDATION PROCEDURES: Before commit (git diff --cached | grep -i 'sk-proj', git status, review all staged files), Test configuration (from ai_services import get_ai_status; print(get_ai_status()), check health endpoint /health), Monitor for leaks (use git-secrets or truffleHog tools, GitHub secret scanning alerts). EMERGENCY RESPONSE IF KEY EXPOSED: 1. Revoke immediately (delete key in OpenAI/Anthropic dashboard), 2. Create new key (generate replacement), 3. Update everywhere (environment variables, cloud configs, local .env), 4. Remove from git history (use BFG Repo-Cleaner or git filter-branch, force push with caution), 5. Monitor usage (check for unauthorized API calls, review billing), 6. Report if needed (contact support for fraudulent charges). GITHUB SECRETS SETUP: Navigate to Repository \u2192 Settings \u2192 Secrets and variables \u2192 Actions, Click New repository secret, Add OPENAI_API_KEY with actual value, Reference in workflows (env: OPENAI_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.OPENAI_API_KEY }}), Secrets never exposed in logs or pull requests. PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT: Use cloud platform native secrets (not .env files), Separate keys per environment (dev/staging/production), Rotate keys regularly (quarterly or after team changes), Monitor API usage and costs (set up alerts), Use least privilege (separate keys for different services). TESTING WITHOUT EXPOSING: Health endpoint shows status without keys (returns boolean openai_key_set), Log partial keys only (sk-proj...X7zQ format), Mock API responses in unit tests (no real keys needed), Use test API keys in CI/CD (separate from production). FILES AFFECTED: .gitignore - Enhanced with investment_app specific ignores, investment_app/.env - Created with placeholders and warnings, investment_app/API_KEY_SECURITY.md - Complete security documentation, app.py - Already loads with python-dotenv (try-except), ai_services.py - Already uses os.environ.get() pattern. DEVELOPER EDUCATION: Setup scripts remind to replace placeholders (setup-env.ps1 and setup-env.sh have warnings), .env file has prominent \u26a0\ufe0f warnings, API_KEY_SECURITY.md provides comprehensive guide, README.md links to security documentation. Stored in investment_app/.env (protected), investment_app/API_KEY_SECURITY.md (committed safely), .gitignore (enhanced). Completes secure credential management: Generate key \u2192 Store in .env (gitignored) \u2192 Load via environment \u2192 Use in application \u2192 Never commit \u2192 Rotate regularly. Next steps: Add pre-commit hooks to scan for keys, Implement automatic key rotation system, Create admin UI for key management, Add monitoring for suspicious API usage, Set up alerts for key exposure in GitHub."
