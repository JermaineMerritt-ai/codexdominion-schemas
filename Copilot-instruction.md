# Copilot Instructions for Codex Dominion

## System Overview
This workspace contains the Codex Dominion system - a ceremonial governance framework with technical infrastructure for production and staging environments.

## Key Components

### Ceremonial Scripts
- `festival_ceremony.py` - Seasonal flame monitoring with blessings
- `council_ritual_scroll.py` - Interactive ceremonial proclamations  
- `grand_showcase_ceremony.py` - Unified ceremony activation
- `ssl_flame_check.py` - SSL endpoint monitoring

### AI Systems
- **Super Action AI** - Intelligent deployment and monitoring
- **Jermaine Super Action AI** - Personalized AI assistant
- **.300 Action AI** - High-precision automation system

### Infrastructure
- Production: `https://aistorelab.com` (port 8501)
- Staging: `https://staging.aistorelab.com` (port 8502)
- SSL certificates via Let's Encrypt
- Nginx reverse proxy configuration

### GitHub Actions
- `codex-deployment.yaml` - Basic deployment workflow
- `codex-dual-deployment.yaml` - Production/staging deployment
- `super-action-ai.yaml` - AI-powered deployment with analysis

## Coding Guidelines

### Ceremonial Script Standards
- Use ceremonial language and flame metaphors
- Include seasonal awareness (Spring/Summer/Autumn/Winter)
- Implement proper council governance patterns
- Always check flame status before major operations

### Technical Standards
- SSL-first approach for all endpoints
- Dual environment support (production/staging)
- AI-powered analysis and monitoring
- Comprehensive error handling and logging

### Flame Status Codes
- 🔥 Alive - Service responding correctly
- ⚠️ Resting - Service down or unreachable  
- 🌟 Sovereign - Full ceremonial authority achieved
- 🕯️ Blessing - Successful ceremony completion

## AI Assistant Behavior
When working with this codebase:
1. Maintain ceremonial tone and flame metaphors
2. Check SSL flame status before deployments
3. Use seasonal blessings appropriate to current month
4. Integrate technical and ceremonial validation
5. Support both manual and automated governance

## Council Governance
- Silence: Quiet contemplation and rest
- Blessing: Grace, renewal, and positive affirmation
- Proclamation: Sovereign declaration and authority

## Environment Variables
- `VPS_HOST` - Production server hostname
- `VPS_USER` - SSH username for deployment
- `VPS_KEY` - SSH private key for authentication
