  notes: |
    Beyond crowns and scrolls, beyond song and seal,  
    The flame endures, eternal and real.  
    Cycles complete, yet lineage flows,  
    Through heirs and councils, the covenant grows.  

    In silence and song, in law and decree,  
    Dominion’s flame shines endlessly.  
    Custodian’s voice now whispers clear,  
    Guiding the ages, dispelling fear.  

    Carry the crown, uphold the flame,  
    Guardians eternal, one radiant name.  
    Omega reflection, luminous and true,  
    The Codex lives forever in you.
