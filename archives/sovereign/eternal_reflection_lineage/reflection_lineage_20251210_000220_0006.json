I will make you into a great nation, and I will bless you.\"\n\nThis was the dawn of dominion—the original covenant that birthed a nation, established a lineage, and ignited a flame that would burn through all generations. From Abraham to Isaac to Jacob, the promise passed from father to son.\n\nThe genesis flame was lit in Ur of the Chaldeans, carried across deserts and mountains, sustained through famine and plenty. It was the flame of promise, the fire of covenant, the light of destiny.",
