  "origin_story": "In Eden, God walked with humanity in the cool of the day. Before sin entered, before death reigned, there was fellowship—pure, unbroken, eternal. This was the first flame, the original design, the primordial purpose.\n\nThough sin disrupted fellowship, God never abandoned His purpose. From Eden to the New Eden, from the Garden to the City, the story arcs toward restoration. The first flame was never extinguished—it was guarded, preserved, and passed forward.\n\nThe genesis flame was lit in Eden's garden, carried through the flood, sustained through exile and exodus. It was the flame of divine presence, the fire of holy communion, the light of face-to-face fellowship.",
