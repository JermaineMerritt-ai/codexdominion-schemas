The church was born in wind and fire, word and wonder.\n\nThis was the dawn of a new dominion—the founding vision of a global ekklesia, a family spanning all nations, a kingdom advancing through every generation. What began in an upper room would spread to the uttermost parts of the earth.\n\nThe genesis flame was kindled in Jerusalem, carried by apostles and evangelists, sustained by martyrs and missionaries. It was the flame of the Great Commission, the fire of apostolic passion, the light of Gospel truth.",
