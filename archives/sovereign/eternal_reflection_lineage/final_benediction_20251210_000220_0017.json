Let every generation understand themselves in this eternal plan, called to fellowship, destined for communion.\n\nWhat God purposed in Eden, let no one despair. What God promises for eternity, let no one doubt. What God seals in covenant, let no force annul.\n\nThis purpose is FROM THE BEGINNING. This promise is TO THE END. This dominion is FOREVER AND EVER.",
