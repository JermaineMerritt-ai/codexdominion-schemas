  "future_prophecy": "Thus promises the Lord of the first and last:\n\nEden lost shall be Eden restored. The fellowship broken in the garden shall be renewed in the city. What Adam forfeited, the Last Adam reclaims. The first flame shall burn brightest at the end.\n\nFuture generations will walk with God as Enoch walked. They will know Him face to face, even as Moses did. The tabernacle shall give way to the temple, the temple to the incarnation, the incarnation to eternal presence.\n\nThis is My desire from the beginning: to dwell with My people forever.",
