  "future_prophecy": "Thus says the Lord concerning generations yet unborn:\n\nThe covenant made with Abraham shall never be broken. Though kingdoms rise and fall, though empires come and go, the promise remains sure. From this lineage shall come kings and priests, prophets and apostles.\n\nThe flame lit in ancient days shall burn in distant ages. Future generations will look back and see the faithfulness of God spanning millennia. They will draw strength from the patriarchs, wisdom from the ancients, courage from the founders.\n\nGuard this lineage. Honor this heritage. Walk worthy of this calling.",
