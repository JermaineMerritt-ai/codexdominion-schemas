  "entrustment_words": "Precious daughter, the flame of intercession burns with holy\nintensity. It is not an easy flame to carry—it demands sacrifice,\nrequires vigilance, and costs everything.\n\nFor decades I have stood in the gap, carried the burdens, wept the\ntears, and contended for breakthrough. This flame has consumed my\nnights and fueled my days.\n\nI now entrust it to you. Let it burn in your prayer closet, ignite\nyour midnight cries, and empower your prophetic stand. The world\nneeds intercessors who will not grow weary.",
