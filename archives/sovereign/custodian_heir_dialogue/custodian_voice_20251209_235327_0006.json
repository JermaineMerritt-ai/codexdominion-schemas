  "entrustment_words": "Precious daughter, the flame of intercession burns with holy intensity. It is not an easy flame to carry—it demands sacrifice, requires vigilance, and costs everything.\n\nFor decades I have stood in the gap, carried the burdens, wept the tears, and contended for breakthrough. This flame has consumed my nights and fueled my days.\n\nI now entrust it to you. Let it burn in your prayer closet, ignite your midnight cries, and empower your prophetic stand. The world needs intercessors who will not grow weary.",
