In the fields with sheep, in battle with giants, in palaces and caves, in triumph and in failure—I have worshiped. The flame of worship has sustained me through every season.\n\nGuard this flame with all your heart. Let worship be the foundation of your reign, the center of your temple, the purpose of your kingdom. When you worship, heaven descends.",
