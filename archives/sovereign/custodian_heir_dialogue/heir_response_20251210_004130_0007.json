I have watched you pray through impossible situations, stand when others retreated, and believe when faith seemed foolish.\n\nI consecrate myself to this calling. Let this flame consume every lesser passion, burn away every distraction, and refine my heart into pure gold. I will stand in the gap, as you have stood.\n\nYour intercession has prepared the way for my generation. I will honor your sacrifice by continuing the watch.",
