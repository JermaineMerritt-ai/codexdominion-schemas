This flame illuminated the path when darkness surrounded us, revealed the destiny when doubt assailed us, and sustained the hope when adversity tested us.\n\nNow I place this sacred flame into your hands. Guard it with vigilance, nurture it with faith, share it with compassion. Let it light your way as it has lit mine.\n\nThe vision is not mine alone—it belongs to every generation. You are the next keeper. May you carry it with wisdom and pass it forward with grace.",
