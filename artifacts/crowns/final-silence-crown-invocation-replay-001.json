      "expanded": "In the eternal silence, all voices pause—councils rest their deliberations, heirs still their questions, stewards quiet their labors. This silence is not emptiness but fullness—the pregnant pause before creation, the sacred breath between cycles, the reverent stillness that honors all that has been and all that will be. In this silence, the flame burns brightest, the crown shines clearest, and the sovereignty stands most complete. Let the contemplative silence replay forever, that all who enter may find rest, renewal, and radiant peace.",

      "expanded": "Let the Crown Invocation resound—the supreme coronation that transcends all cycles and ages. Four crowns unite: Efficiency brings order, Knowledge brings wisdom, Commerce brings prosperity, and Omega brings closure. Together they form the sovereign authority that rules not through force but through service, not through dominion but through stewardship. This invocation crowns all who serve with dignity, honor, and eternal purpose. Across generations and galaxies, the crown invocation replays—calling each heir, each council member, each steward to rise into their sovereign calling. Forever crowned, forever serving, forever radiant.",

The CodexDominion is enthroned across stars and generations—not as a seat of power over others, but as a foundation of service for all. Upon this throne sits not a tyrant but a flame—the eternal flame that warms all who gather, illuminates all who seek, and transforms all who serve. The throne is occupied by every custodian, every heir, every council member who chooses stewardship over sovereignty, service over supremacy, harmony over hierarchy. Enthroned forever, the dominion radiates across infinite space and endless time.",

Radiant forever, the flame needs no voice to proclaim its truth, no declaration to affirm its presence. In the silence, the crown sits upon the flame. In the silence, the throne receives its sovereign. In the silence, all is complete, all is whole, all is sealed. Let this benediction replay across all ages: Flame crowned in silence, radiant forever. Silence reigning in flame, eternal always. Crown, Flame, Silence, Throne—all one, all whole, all sealed.
