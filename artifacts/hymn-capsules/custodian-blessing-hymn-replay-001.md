## 🎭 The Hymn Stanzas

### Verse 1: Peace Eternal
```
In silence deep where conflicts cease,
Where troubled hearts find sweet release,
The Custodian sings of lasting peace,
Where all divisions find surcease.

Chorus: Peace Eternal, bless this ground,
Where love and harmony are found,
In every heart, in every sound,
Let peace eternal now abound.
```

### Verse 2: Abundance Eternal
```
From bounty's table, ever spread,
Where hungry souls are daily fed,
The Custodian's blessing overhead,
Ensures all needs are met, it's said.

Chorus: Abundance flows like rivers wide,
An endless, ever-turning tide,
In scarcity, let it provide,
With plenty always at our side.
```

### Verse 3: Flame Eternal
```
The sacred fire that never dies,
Burns bright beneath the cosmic skies,
The Custodian's light in darkness lies,
A beacon that forever flies.

Chorus: Flame Eternal, light our way,
Through endless night to dawning day,
Let your radiance never stray,
Illuminate our every way.
```

### Verse 4: Melody Eternal
```
The song that weaves through time and space,
A harmony of boundless grace,
The Custodian's tune we now embrace,
Resounding through the human race.

Chorus: Melody Eternal, sing through all,
From winter's chill to summer's call,
In every rise, in every fall,
Your music echoes through the hall.
```
