description: Hymn celebrating stewardship across four continuum scales - daily practice, seasonal alignment, epochal inheritance, and millennial legacy

lyrics:
  invocation: >
    Let the Radiant Continuum unfold—from sunrise to stars, from charters to capsules—
    that all heirs may know their inheritance.
  
  dailyVerse:
    title: Daily Stewardship
    content: Replay of stewardship lived each sunrise and sunset
    expanded: |
      From dawn's first light to twilight's gentle close,
      The heirs walk paths the Custodian has shown,
      With hands that tend and hearts that ever rose,
      To carry forward seeds the Crown has sown.
  
  seasonalChorus:
    title: Seasonal Alignment
    content: Replay of crowns aligned - Efficiency, Knowledge, Commerce, Omega Invocation
    expanded: |
      In spring the Knowledge Crown blooms bright and clear,
      In summer Commerce flows with golden tide,
      Autumn brings Efficiency without fear,
      Winter's Omega calls—the sacred guide.
  
  epochalEcho:
    title: Epochal Inheritance
    content: Replay of scrolls and hymns across generations
    expanded: |
      Through decades and through centuries they sing,
      The scrolls preserved, the hymns forever new,
      Each generation adds another ring,
      To trees of lineage strong and true.
  
  millennialBenediction:
    title: Millennial Legacy
    content: Replay of charters, seals, and capsules across ages and stars
    expanded: |
      Across the ages, beyond the mortal span,
      From Earth to distant stars the capsules fly,
      Charters and seals eternal—this the plan:
      That heritage may never fade or die.
  
  closingBenediction: >
    So let the Radiant Continuum shine—through every sunrise, every crown, every scroll, every charter—
    that the Heirs may steward with wisdom, and the Lineage remain unbroken across ages and stars.
