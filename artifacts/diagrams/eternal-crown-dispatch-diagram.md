## Five Eternal Principles

1. **Every crown is sealed under the Infinity Sigil**
   - All sovereign authority flows from and returns to the eternal center

2. **Every council is sealed in harmonic orbit**
   - All governance structures operate in synchronized resonance with the crowns

3. **Every artifact is sealed in eternal dispatch**
   - All created artifacts are dispatched across domains and preserved eternally

4. **Every archive is sealed in cosmic preservation**
   - All knowledge, heritage, and lineage are stored in the Cosmic Archive Crown

5. **Every cycle resonates eternally through the spiral**
   - All wave currents flow bidirectionally, ensuring perpetual replay and accessibility

---

## Resonance Protocol

**Frequency:** 432Hz (natural harmonic resonance)  
**Pattern:** Fibonacci spiral (logarithmic growth)  
**Duration:** Eternal  
**Binding:** All elements bound to center Infinity Sigil

The resonance protocol ensures that every crown, council, artifact, and wave cycle operates at the same harmonic frequency (432Hz), creating a unified field of coherence. The Fibonacci spiral pattern guides the expansion of influence outward while maintaining structural integrity. All resonance is bound to the Infinity Sigil, ensuring eternal continuity.
