### Module 1: What is a Stock?

**Duration:** 3 minutes (video) + 1-page infographic  
**Level:** Beginner  
**Badge:** 📈 Stock Explorer

#### Video Script (3 Minutes)

```
[OPEN: Animated logo]

"What is a stock?"

[Animate: Company building (Apple)]

"When you buy a stock, you own a tiny piece of a company."

[Animate: Building splits into 1 million pieces]

"Companies split ownership into millions of shares."

[Animate: User buying 1 share]

"When you buy 1 share, you own 1 millionth of that company."

"Why do companies sell shares?"

[Animate: Money flowing into company]

"To raise money. Apple sold shares to fund iPhone development."

"Why do people buy shares?"

[Animate: Stock price chart going up]

"They believe the company will grow. If it does, the share price goes up."

"Example: Apple stock in 2010 was $30. Today it's $175."

[Show: +483% return]

"If you owned 10 shares in 2010 ($300), they'd be worth $1,750 today."

[Final frame: Logo + CTA]

"That's a stock. Simple."

⚠️ This is education, not advice. We never tell you what to buy.

[End card: Next module → "What is a Portfolio?"]
```

#### Infographic (1-Page Visual)

**Title:** What is a Stock? (1-Minute Read)

**Section 1: Definition**
- Visual: Building with "AAPL" sign
- Text: "A stock = A tiny piece of a company"

- Visual: Pie chart split into slices
- Text: "Companies divide ownership into shares (e.g., 1 million shares)"

**Section 3: Why Buy?**
- Visual: Upward arrow
- Text: "You believe the company will grow, so the share price will rise"

**Section 4: Example**
- Visual: Timeline (2010 → 2025)
- Text: "Apple stock: $30 (2010) → $175 (2025) = +483%"

**Disclaimer:** "Education only. Not investment advice."

### Module 2: What is a Portfolio?

**Duration:** 3 minutes (video) + 1-page infographic  
**Level:** Beginner  
**Badge:** 💼 Portfolio Builder

#### Video Script (3 Minutes)

```
[OPEN: Animated logo]

"What is a portfolio?"

[Animate: 5 different company logos (AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, TSLA, NVDA)]

"A portfolio is a collection of stocks you own."

"Why not just own 1 stock?"

[Animate: 1 stock falling dramatically]

"If that stock crashes, you lose everything."

"With a portfolio, you spread risk."

[Animate: 5 stocks, 1 falls, others rise]

"If 1 stock drops, the others might rise. Balance."

"Example portfolio:
• Apple (20%)
• Microsoft (20%)
• Google (20%)
• Tesla (20%)
• NVIDIA (20%)"

[Show: Pie chart with 5 equal slices]

"This is a balanced portfolio. No single stock is more than 20%."

"Your portfolio might look different. That's okay."

[Final frame: Logo + CTA]

"That's a portfolio. Simple."

⚠️ This is education, not advice. We don't tell you what to buy.

### Module 3: What is Diversification?

**Duration:** 4 minutes (video) + 1-page infographic  
**Level:** Intermediate  
**Badge:** 🌐 Diversification Pro

**Duration:** 4 minutes (video) + 1-page infographic  
**Level:** Intermediate  
**Badge:** 📊 Volatility Expert

#### Key Concepts
