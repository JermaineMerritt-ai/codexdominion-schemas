---

## Operational Model

### Autonomous Execution
Each engine operates **autonomously** with these characteristics:

1. **Self-Triggering**: Engines initiate operations based on schedules, events, or thresholds
2. **Cross-Communication**: Engines coordinate through shared data and event streams
3. **Error Handling**: Built-in fallback mechanisms and retry logic
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Self-assessment and optimization
5. **Heir/Council Transparency**: All operations archived with access controls

### Coordination Patterns

#### Sequential Coordination
Some engines must execute in sequence:
```
Product Innovation → Content Genesis → Store Operations → Social Amplification
```

#### Parallel Coordination
Some engines execute simultaneously:
```
Store Operations + Site Orchestration + Social Amplification (during LAUNCH phase)
```

#### Feedback Loop Coordination
Some engines create iterative improvement cycles:
```
Data Analytics → Revenue Optimization → Store Operations → Data Analytics (repeat)
```
