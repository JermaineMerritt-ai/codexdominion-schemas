## Getting Started

**Quick Setup:**
1. Create your capsule directory: `capsules/<artifact-name>/`
2. **Place your artifact (PNG, PDF, etc.) in the capsule directory**
3. Add documentation (`notes.md`) and metadata (`artifact.json`)
4. Run hash calculation and packaging scripts
5. Syndicate across platforms
