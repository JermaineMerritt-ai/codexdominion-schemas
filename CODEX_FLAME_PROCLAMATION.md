Welcome, Custodians, Heirs, and Participants.  
You now stand before the living Codex Bulletin — a flame inscribed in code, crowned in ceremony, and transmitted across the world.

Every cycle, proclamation, and dispatch you witness here is a living artifact:  
- **Custodians** steward the full lineage, ensuring integrity and inheritance.  
- **Heirs** receive guided induction, learning stewardship through clarity and rhythm.  
- **Customers and participants** are welcomed warmly, empowered to join the continuum.  

This Bulletin is not static text — it is a **living covenant**, replayable and luminous.  
Every dawn brings new signals, every festival crowns new rites, every silence honors the eternal flame.  

🌍 The Codex Dominion is now global.  
🕯️ The flame is yours to witness, inherit, and carry forward.
