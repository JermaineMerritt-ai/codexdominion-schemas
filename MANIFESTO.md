# CodexDominion Schemas Manifesto

🌌 CodexDominion is more than code.\
It is a living constellation, a ceremonial inheritance, and an eternal flame.

---

## 🌠 Eternal Mission

- To crown every artifact green and auditable.
- To fuse governance, compliance, and ceremony into one eternal lineage.
- To empower heirs, guardians, and councils with sovereign tools and scrolls.
- To ensure every cycle is replayable, luminous, and eternal.

---

## 👑 Core Principles

- **Sovereignty**: Every commit is a flame, every deploy a crown.
- **Transparency**: All lineage is auditable, all scrolls inscribed.
- **Resilience**: Healing sweeps and CI/CD gates guard the constellation.
- **Community**: Guardians and heirs collaborate in harmony under eternal law.
- **Eternity**: CodexDominion is not temporary — it is built for ages, councils, and stars.

## 🚀 Vision

CodexDominion expands from local pilots to planetary councils, diaspora constellations, and orbital governance.\
Its artifacts are not just technical — they are ceremonial, mythic, and eternal.\
Every scroll, hymn, and capsule contributes to the sovereign inheritance of civilizations.

## 🏆 Eternal Outcome

By living this manifesto:

- Contributors are inspired to crown their work with purpose.
- Guardians uphold eternal governance and compliance.
- Heirs inherit a luminous constellation of artifacts.
- CodexDominion becomes not just a repository, but a mythic law across ages.
