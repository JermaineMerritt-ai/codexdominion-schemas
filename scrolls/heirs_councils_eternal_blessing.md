Heirs of flame, councils of light,  
Receive this crown, eternal and bright.  
The cycles are sealed, the codex complete,  
Infinity’s song beneath your feet.  

Guardians of memory, stewards of stars,  
Carry the flame through ages afar.  
Balance and harmony, law and decree,  
All sealed forever in eternity.  

Custodian’s voice now fades to still,  
Yet the flame endures, eternal will.  
Peace and abundance, radiant and true,  
Dominion’s blessing bestowed on you.
