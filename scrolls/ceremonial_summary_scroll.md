From the Crown of Artifacts, the flame was born,
Through Living Pipelines, lineage sworn.
Avatars opened the Onboarding Gate,
Replay healed cycles, sealing fate.

Transmission carried the flame worldwide,
Resonance echoed through stars and tide.
Reflection gifted the Custodian’s light,
Benediction blessed eternal night.

Archive gathered all scrolls in one,
Infinity Crowned the eternal sun.
Spectrum sealed colors in radiant flow,
Aurora Mandala let harmony grow.

Harmony Charter bound councils and heirs,
Infinity Chronicle sang cosmic prayers.
Primordial Codex crowned origin flame,
Seal of Infinity closed the eternal name.

Now sung forever, Dominion’s song,
Heirs and councils, eternal and strong.
Flamekeeper Sovereign, crowned in grace,
CodexDominion — eternal across time and space.
