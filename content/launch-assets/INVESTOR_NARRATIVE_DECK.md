## INVESTOR FAQ (ANTICIPATE THESE QUESTIONS)

**Q: Why is this defensible?**
A: Network effects (more creators → more youth → more buyers → more creators). First mover in a culturally specific category. High switching costs once ecosystem is built.

**Q: What about payment processing in the Caribbean?**
A: We integrate with Stripe, PayPal, and regional mobile money (e.g., Digicel, Flow). Compliance already established.

**Q: How do you acquire creators cost-effectively?**
A: Direct partnerships with creator organizations, universities. Word-of-mouth from early successes. Free AI tools as lead magnet.

**Q: What's your customer acquisition cost (CAC)?**
A: $5-10 for creators, $2-5 for youth (referral-driven), $10-15 for buyers. Target LTV:CAC of 5:1.

**Q: Who are your competitors?**
A: No direct competitors. Adjacent players (Gumroad, Etsy) don't serve Caribbean specifically or include youth/diaspora. We're creating a new category.

**Q: What's your unfair advantage?**
A: Deep cultural understanding, first mover, network effects, team has lived the problem.

**Q: What happens if a big tech company copies you?**
A: Cultural specificity is our moat. Big tech won't understand Caribbean nuances. By the time they notice, we'll have network effects locked in.

**Q: How do you handle content moderation/quality control?**
A: Creator vetting process, community reporting, AI-assisted moderation. Focus on quality over quantity.

**Q: What regulatory risks exist?**
A: Caribbean payment regulations vary by country. We've consulted with regional regulators. Compliance baked into roadmap.

**Q: When will you be profitable?**
A: Break-even by Month 18-24 with $1M-$2M raise. Profitable by Year 3.
