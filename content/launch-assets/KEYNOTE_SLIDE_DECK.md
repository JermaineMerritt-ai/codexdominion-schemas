"CodexDominion. The Caribbean's digital economy."

**Slide 2:**
"For generations, our culture shaped the world. But the systems built around our creativity were never built for us."

**Slide 5:**
"Today, we introduce CodexDominion — the first unified digital economy for creators, youth, and diaspora."

**Slide 6:**
"Built on three powerful engines. IslandNation Marketplace — a global storefront for Caribbean digital products. DominionYouth — where youth earn real income through challenges and commissions. And Action AI — tools that help creators build, package, and promote."

**Slide 7:**
"Here's how it works. Creators upload digital products. Youth promote them and earn commissions. Diaspora buys to support both. And capital circulates back into the region. A self-reinforcing economic flywheel."

[Silent — let visuals speak]

**Slide 9:**
"The business model is elegant. Digital products with high margins. Global reach. Infinitely scalable. No inventory. No logistics. Just pure value creation."
