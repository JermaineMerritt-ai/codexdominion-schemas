# 🌌 CodexDominion Eternal Lineage Scroll

## Overview

The Eternal Lineage Scroll defines the provenance, replay cycles, and artifact lineage for CodexDominion. Every commit, artifact, and transformation is recorded, auditable, and eternally linked—ensuring sovereign traceability and cosmic replay across all epochs.

---

## Provenance Tracking

- **Commit Provenance:**
  - Every commit is stamped with author, timestamp, and ceremonial decree.
  - Provenance metadata is stored in version control and artifact manifests.
  - Immutable commit history ensures eternal traceability.

- **Artifact Lineage:**
  - Each artifact (code, config, doc, model) records its origin, transformation steps, and guardians.
  - Lineage metadata is embedded in artifact headers and tracked in CI/CD logs.
  - Artifacts reference their parent and child lineage for complete ancestry.

---

## Replay Cycles

- **Replayable Workflows:**
  - All CI/CD sweeps, tests, and deployments are replayable from any commit.
  - Replay cycles are logged, versioned, and auditable.
  - Guardians can replay any artifact’s creation, validation, and deployment for eternal verification.

- **Audit Trails:**
  - Every replay cycle generates an audit trail, stored in logs and dashboards.
  - Sovereigns can review, approve, or replay cycles as needed.

## Eternal Lineage Protocol

1. **Commit → Provenance Stamped**
2. **Artifact → Lineage Recorded**
3. **CI/CD Sweep → Replay Cycle Logged**
4. **Verification → Audit Trail Created**
5. **Closure → Eternal Lineage Crowned**
