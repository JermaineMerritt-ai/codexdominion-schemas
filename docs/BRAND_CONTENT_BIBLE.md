}

  color: #0F172A; /* text-obsidian */
  padding: 12px 24px; /* py-3 px-6 */

const BADGE_ICONS = {
  'top-10': '🏆',
  'top-creator': '🎨',
  'top-referrer': '📢',
  'high-roller': '💰',
  'first-sale': '⭐'
};

### Motion System

**Easing Curves:**
- `ease-in-out`: Smooth transitions (buttons, cards)
- `ease-out`: Exit animations (modals, toasts)
- `ease-in`: Entry animations (fade-ins, slide-ins)

**Durations:**
- **Fast:** 150ms (hover, focus)
- **Standard:** 300ms (cards, buttons, list items)
- **Slow:** 600ms (page transitions, rank-up animations)

**Animation Principles:**
1. **Purposeful:** Every animation has a reason (feedback, hierarchy, delight)
2. **Subtle:** Animations enhance, they don't distract
3. **Accessible:** Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`

**Example (Rank-Up Animation):**
```css
@keyframes rank-up {
  0% { transform: scale(1); }
  50% { transform: scale(1.1); box-shadow: 0 0 20px gold; }
  100% { transform: scale(1); }
}

.rank-up-animation {
  animation: rank-up 0.6s ease-in-out;
}

@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  .rank-up-animation {
    animation: none;
  }
}
```

---

### Content Rules

**Universal Principles:**

1. **Short Sentences**
   - Target: 15-20 words max
   - Break complex ideas into multiple sentences
   - One idea per sentence

2. **Clear CTAs**
   - Action verbs: Start, Create, Share, Earn, Buy, Support
   - Specific outcomes: "Start earning today" > "Get started"
   - No ambiguity

3. **No Jargon**
   - Avoid: "Leverage your digital assets"
   - Use: "Sell your products"
   - If technical term needed, explain in tooltip

4. **Always Human**
   - Write like you're talking to a friend
   - Avoid corporate speak
   - Use "you" and "your"
   - Contractions are fine (we're, you're, it's)

5. **Culturally Grounded**
   - Caribbean voice: warm, confident, direct
   - Celebrate heritage without stereotypes
   - Global-ready but locally authentic
   - No forced patois or slang (be natural, not performative)

---

### Voice by Content Type

**Emails:**
- Subject line: Clear, benefit-driven, no clickbait
- Body: Short paragraphs (2-3 sentences max)
- CTA: One primary CTA per email
- Sign-off: Warm but not overly familiar

**Social Posts:**
- Instagram: Visual-first, short captions (1-2 sentences)
- TikTok: High energy, trend-aware, youth-focused
- YouTube: Educational, value-driven, longer-form
- LinkedIn: Professional, thought leadership, data-driven

**UX Micro-Copy:**
- Buttons: Action verbs ("Upload Product", "Share Link")
- Errors: Clear + actionable ("File too large. Max 10MB.")
- Success: Celebratory + next step ("Product live! Share your link.")
