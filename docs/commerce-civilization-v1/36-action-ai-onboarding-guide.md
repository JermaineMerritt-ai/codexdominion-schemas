---

## SECTION 2: HOW TO GIVE EFFECTIVE INSTRUCTIONS

The quality of Action AI outputs depends heavily on the clarity of your instructions. Follow these three principles:

---

### 2.1 Principle 1: Be Clear

**What This Means:**
Say exactly what you want in simple, direct language.

**Examples:**

❌ **Unclear:** "I need something about launching."  
✅ **Clear:** "Create a checklist for launching a digital product."

❌ **Unclear:** "Help me with my email."  
✅ **Clear:** "Write a professional email introducing our new course."

❌ **Unclear:** "Can you do something with this text?"  
✅ **Clear:** "Summarize this text in three bullet points."

**Why This Matters:**
Clear requests reduce back-and-forth, save time, and produce better results on the first attempt.

---

### 2.2 Principle 2: Be Specific

**What This Means:**
Include relevant details that affect the output.

**Examples:**

**Good Specificity:**
- "Write a **short**, **professional** email introducing our new course."
- "Create a checklist for launching a digital product **in less than 30 days**."
- "Summarize this text in **three bullet points**, focusing on **key benefits**."

**Details That Matter:**
- Length (short, medium, long / word count / bullet count)
- Tone (professional, casual, friendly, formal)
- Audience (customers, team members, partners)
- Format (list, paragraph, table, outline)
- Focus (benefits, process, features, timeline)

**Details That Don't Matter:**
- How the AI should think about the task
- Step-by-step process instructions for the AI
- Technical implementation details

**Why This Matters:**
Specificity ensures the output matches your expectations without requiring multiple revisions.

---

### 2.3 Principle 3: Be Direct

**What This Means:**
Ask for the output you want, not the process.

**Examples:**

❌ **Process-Focused:** "Can you think about how to structure a product launch checklist?"  
✅ **Output-Focused:** "Create a product launch checklist."

❌ **Process-Focused:** "I'd like you to analyze this text and then give me a summary."  
✅ **Output-Focused:** "Summarize this text."

❌ **Process-Focused:** "Could you help me figure out how to organize these bullet points?"  
✅ **Output-Focused:** "Organize these bullet points by category."

**Why This Matters:**
Direct requests eliminate unnecessary steps and get you to results faster.

---

### 2.4 Effective Instruction Template

Use this template for best results:

```
[Action Verb] + [What You Want] + [Key Details]

Examples:
- "Create a social media post promoting our holiday sale."
- "Summarize this article in 5 bullet points focusing on key benefits."
- "Rewrite this product description to be more concise and customer-focused."
- "Draft a professional email thanking a customer for their order."
```

**Action Verbs That Work Well:**
- Create, Write, Draft, Generate (for new content)
- Summarize, Condense, Extract (for shortening)
- Rewrite, Revise, Improve (for modifications)
- Organize, Structure, Arrange (for organization)
- Compare, Analyze, Identify (for analysis)

---

## SECTION 3: WHAT ACTION AI CAN DO

- "Fill in this template with the provided information."

**What You'll Get:**
Polished, ready-to-use deliverables that save you assembly time.

---

## SECTION 4: WHAT ACTION AI CANNOT DO

To keep the system safe, predictable, and aligned, Action AI has **clear boundaries**. Understanding these helps you use the system effectively.

---

### 4.1 Strategic Decisions

**What This Means:**
Action AI does not make business, strategic, or high-stakes decisions.

**Examples of What's Restricted:**
- Pricing strategy decisions
- Hiring or firing recommendations
- Budget allocation decisions
- Strategic partnership choices
- Product line decisions

**Why This Boundary Exists:**
Strategic decisions require human judgment, business context, and accountability that AI cannot provide.

**What to Do Instead:**
Ask Action AI to provide **analysis or options**, then you make the decision.

**Example:**
❌ "Should I price my course at $97 or $197?"  
✅ "Compare the pros and cons of pricing at $97 vs $197."

---

### 4.2 Legal, Medical, or Financial Advice

**What This Means:**
Action AI cannot provide advice in domains requiring professional licenses.

**Examples of What's Restricted:**
- Legal guidance (contracts, compliance, liability)
- Medical advice (diagnosis, treatment, health decisions)
- Financial advice (investment recommendations, tax guidance)

**Why This Boundary Exists:**
These domains have legal, ethical, and safety implications that require licensed professionals.

**What to Do Instead:**
Ask Action AI to provide **general information or templates**, then consult a professional.

**Example:**
❌ "What legal structure should I use for my business?"  
✅ "Create a checklist of questions to ask my lawyer about business structures."

---

### 4.3 Sensitive Content Interpretation

**What This Means:**
Action AI avoids interpreting deeply personal, emotional, or sensitive content.

**Examples of What's Restricted:**
- Interpersonal conflict resolution
- Emotional counseling
- Relationship advice
- Sensitive personal data handling

**Why This Boundary Exists:**
These topics require empathy, context, and human judgment that AI cannot replicate safely.

**What to Do Instead:**
Ask Action AI to help with **structure or communication**, not judgment or interpretation.

**Example:**
❌ "How should I handle this conflict with my business partner?"  
✅ "Draft a professional email template for addressing business disagreements."

---

### 4.4 Autonomous Action

**What This Means:**
Action AI does not act on its own without explicit instruction.

**Examples of What's Restricted:**
- Publishing content without approval
- Sending emails or messages
- Making purchases or transactions
- Deleting or modifying existing files
- Scheduling or booking automatically

**Why This Boundary Exists:**
Autonomous actions can have unintended consequences. Human approval ensures alignment with your goals.

**What Action AI Does Instead:**
Provides outputs for your review and approval before any action is taken.

---

### 4.5 Symbolic or Ceremonial Language (Unless Requested)

**What This Means:**
Action AI uses clear, professional language by default. Ceremonial, mythic, or symbolic language is avoided unless you specifically request it.

**Examples of Restricted Default Behavior:**
- Grandiose framing ("The flames of sovereignty burn eternal!")
- Symbolic metaphors without context
- Unnecessary formality or ritual language

**Why This Boundary Exists:**
Most users want practical, grounded outputs. Symbolic language can obscure meaning.

**What to Do If You Want It:**
Simply request the tone you prefer.

**Example:**
✅ "Write this in a ceremonial, symbolic style."

---

### 4.6 What Happens If You Approach a Boundary

If your request approaches a restricted domain, Action AI will:

1. **Pause execution**
2. **Identify the boundary concern**
3. **Ask for clarification or guidance**
4. **Offer alternative approaches if applicable**

**Example Escalation:**
```
ESCALATION: Compliance Concern

Your request approaches a restricted domain (pricing strategy).
I can provide analysis of pricing options, but cannot make the final decision.

Would you like me to:
1. Compare pros/cons of each pricing option
2. Provide market research on similar products
3. Something else

Awaiting guidance.
```

This ensures the system stays safe and aligned while still being helpful.

---

## SECTION 5: HOW TO ASK FOR REVISIONS

If the initial output isn't quite right, you can request revisions easily. Action AI revises cleanly without resistance or looping.

---

### 5.1 Revision Request Patterns

**Pattern 1: Clarity**
- "Make this clearer."
- "Simplify this section."
- "Explain this in simpler terms."

**Pattern 2: Length**
- "Shorten this."
- "Expand section 2."
- "Make this more concise."

**Pattern 3: Tone**
- "Rewrite this in a more professional tone."
- "Make this friendlier."
- "This sounds too formal—make it more casual."

**Pattern 4: Structure**
- "Organize this into bullet points."
- "Add section headings."
- "Break this into shorter paragraphs."

**Pattern 5: Content**
- "Add more detail about [specific topic]."
- "Remove the section about [topic]."
- "Focus more on benefits, less on features."

---

### 5.2 How Revisions Work

**Step 1:** You provide feedback or a revision request.  
**Step 2:** Action AI revises the output based on your guidance.  
**Step 3:** You review the revision.  
**Step 4:** If needed, request additional changes (up to 2-3 revision cycles).  
**Step 5:** Approve the final version or escalate if revisions aren't working.

**Revision Limits:**
- Action AI supports **2-3 revision cycles** per task
- After 3 revisions, if output still isn't right, the system escalates to human review
- This prevents looping and ensures efficient resolution

---

### 5.3 Effective Revision Feedback

**Good Revision Feedback:**
✅ "Make the intro shorter and more direct."  
✅ "Add a section about pricing."  
✅ "This tone is too formal—make it friendlier."  
✅ "Organize this into a numbered list."

**Less Effective Feedback:**
❌ "I don't like it." (too vague)  
❌ "Fix this." (no specificity)  
❌ "Something's off." (unclear what needs changing)

**Why Specificity Matters:**
The more specific your feedback, the better the revision will match your expectations.

---

## SECTION 6: HOW ESCALATION WORKS

When Action AI needs more information or encounters a boundary, it uses **escalation** to ask for human guidance.

---

### 6.1 What Triggers Escalation

Action AI escalates when:

1. **Clarification Needed** - Request is unclear or ambiguous
2. **Decision Required** - Multiple valid approaches exist
3. **Compliance Concern** - Request approaches restricted domain
4. **Scope Exceeded** - Task beyond current role capabilities
5. **Conflict Detected** - Contradictory instructions received
6. **Context Insufficient** - Missing critical background information

---

### 6.2 What Escalation Looks Like

When Action AI escalates, you'll see a clear, direct message:

**Example 1: Clarification**
```
ESCALATION: Clarification Needed

You requested a "product description."
Question: Which product should I describe?
Why: I need to know which product to focus on.
```

**Example 2: Decision**
```
ESCALATION: Decision Required

You requested a social media post for our sale.
Options:
1. Focus on urgency (limited time)
2. Focus on value (best deal of the year)
3. Focus on benefits (what customers gain)

Which approach should I take?
```

**Example 3: Compliance**
```
ESCALATION: Compliance Concern

Your request approaches a restricted domain (pricing strategy).
I can provide analysis of pricing options, but cannot make the final decision.

Would you like me to provide comparative analysis instead?
```

---

### 6.3 How to Respond to Escalation

When Action AI escalates:

**Step 1:** Read the escalation message carefully  
**Step 2:** Provide the requested information or decision  
**Step 3:** Action AI continues with your guidance  

**Response Examples:**

For clarification:
- "Describe the Wedding Planning Bundle."

For decision:
- "Focus on urgency—limited time offer."

For compliance:
- "Yes, provide comparative analysis of the pricing options."

---

### 6.4 Escalation Prevents Problems

Escalation is a **feature, not a bug**. It ensures:
- You get exactly what you want (no guessing)
- The system stays within safe boundaries
- Decisions are made by humans, not AI
- Quality remains high through clear communication

**If Action AI escalates, it's doing its job correctly.**

---

## SECTION 7: WORKING WITH MULTIPLE AI ROLES

The Action AI workforce includes **five specialized roles**. You don't need to choose which role to use—the system routes tasks automatically.

---

### 7.1 The Five AI Roles

**1. Creator Support Agent**
- Supports creators with templates, workflows, and operational content
- Ideal for: Templates, process documentation, creator tools

**2. Commerce Operations Agent**
- Manages order flows, customer service, and operational systems
- Ideal for: Process documentation, customer service templates, operational guides

**3. Content & Marketing Agent**
- Creates marketing copy, social content, and advertising materials
- Ideal for: Social posts, ad copy, emails, product descriptions

**4. Documentation & Structuring Agent**
- Creates technical documentation, system designs, and frameworks
- Ideal for: Manuals, knowledge bases, system documentation, frameworks

**5. Intelligence & Insights Agent**
- Analyzes data, identifies patterns, and provides insights
- Ideal for: Summaries, analysis, reports, pattern identification

---

### 7.2 Automatic Task Routing

When you give a request, the system:
1. Identifies the task type
2. Routes to appropriate role
3. Executes within that role's boundaries
4. Delivers the output

**You don't need to think about roles—just give clear instructions.**

---

### 7.3 Multi-Role Tasks

Some complex tasks involve multiple roles:

**Example:**
"Analyze our customer feedback and create a summary report."
- **Intelligence Agent** analyzes feedback (identifies patterns)
- **Documentation Agent** creates summary report (structures findings)

**The system handles handoffs automatically.** You provide one request, get one complete output.

---

## SECTION 8: BEST PRACTICES FOR NEW USERS

Follow these practices to get maximum value from Action AI quickly.

---

### 8.1 Practice 1: Start Simple

**What This Means:**
Begin with short, straightforward requests before moving to complex tasks.

**Good Starting Requests:**
- "Create a checklist for [simple task]."
- "Summarize this text in 3 bullet points."
- "Write a short social media post about [topic]."

**Why This Works:**
Simple tasks help you understand how the system responds and build confidence.

---

### 8.2 Practice 2: Build in Layers

**What This Means:**
Ask for drafts first, then refine through revisions.

**Example Sequence:**
1. "Draft a product description for our digital planner."
2. "Make it more concise."
3. "Add a section about pricing."
4. "Final version approved."

**Why This Works:**
Iterative refinement produces better results than trying to specify everything upfront.

---

### 8.3 Practice 3: Use Clear Formats

**What This Means:**
Explicitly state the format you want.

**Format Requests:**
- "List the top 5 benefits of [product]."
- "Summarize this in paragraph form."
- "Create a table comparing [A] and [B]."
- "Organize this into sections with headings."

**Why This Works:**
Clear format requests eliminate ambiguity about structure.

---

### 8.4 Practice 4: Give Feedback

**What This Means:**
If something feels off, say so. The system improves with your guidance.

**Feedback Examples:**
- "This tone doesn't match our brand—make it more professional."
- "This is too long—cut it in half."
- "Great, but add more detail about [topic]."

**Why This Works:**
Feedback helps the system learn your preferences and produce better results over time.

---

### 8.5 Practice 5: Stay Within Scope

**What This Means:**
Avoid sensitive or high-risk topics that trigger escalation unnecessarily.

**In-Scope Topics:**
- Operational content (checklists, templates, guides)
- Marketing content (posts, emails, descriptions)
- Analysis (summaries, comparisons, insights)
- Organization (structures, frameworks, systems)

**Out-of-Scope Topics:**
- Strategic business decisions
- Legal, medical, financial advice
- Sensitive personal matters

**Why This Works:**
Staying within scope ensures fast, efficient execution without delays.
