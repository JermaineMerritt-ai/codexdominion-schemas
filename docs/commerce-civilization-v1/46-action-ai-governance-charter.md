# ACTION AI SYSTEM GOVERNANCE CHARTER

**Document Control**
- **Manual ID**: 46
- **Version**: 1.0
- **Status**: Active
- **Last Updated**: December 31, 2025
- **Document Type**: Governance Charter

---

## Purpose of the Charter

This charter establishes:
- **who has authority** over the Action AI system
- **how decisions are made**
- **how boundaries are enforced**
- **how updates and improvements are governed**
- **how long-term stewardship is maintained**

It ensures the system remains stable, safe, and aligned as it grows.

---

## 1. Governance Principles

The Action AI system operates under five core governance principles:

### 1. Human Authority
Humans make decisions; AI executes.

### 2. Clarity
Rules, roles, and workflows must remain unambiguous.

### 3. Safety
The system must avoid sensitive or restricted domains.

### 4. Consistency
Outputs must remain stable across time and teams.

### 5. Accountability
Oversight and review are continuous.

**These principles guide every decision and update.**

---

## 2. Governance Roles

### 2.1 System Owner

**Authority**: Ultimate authority over the Action AI system

**Responsibilities**:
- System rules
- Boundaries
- Updates
- Approvals
- Long-term direction

**Accountability**: Ensuring the system remains aligned with organizational goals

### 2.2 System Stewards

**Optional role for larger teams (50+ users)**

**Responsibilities**:
- Maintaining documentation
- Training new users
- Conducting audits
- Monitoring drift
- Collecting feedback

**Purpose**: Ensure day-to-day stability

### 2.3 Team Leaders

**Responsibilities**:
- Users follow system rules
- Outputs meet quality standards
- Boundaries are respected
- Tasks flow correctly

**Role**: First line of oversight

### 2.4 Users

**Responsibilities**:
- Giving clear instructions
- Staying within scope
- Requesting revisions
- Reporting issues

**Role**: Direct system interaction

---

## 3. Authority Structure

Authority flows in a clear hierarchy:

```
System Owner
    ↓
System Stewards (optional)
    ↓
Team Leaders
    ↓
Users
```

**Critical**: AI agents sit outside the hierarchy.
- They do not hold authority
- They follow rules
- They execute instructions

---

## 4. Governance Responsibilities

### 4.1 Rule Definition

The System Owner defines:
- Allowed tasks
- Restricted tasks
- Escalation rules
- Tone and structure standards
- Workflow boundaries

**Documentation**: Operating Charter (Manual 21) and related manuals

### 4.2 Oversight & Review

Governance includes:
- **Daily**: Light monitoring (scan overnight outputs, check escalations)
- **Weekly**: Light checks (review 5-10 outputs, address urgent concerns)
- **Monthly**: Role reviews (audit 20-30 outputs, analyze patterns)
- **Quarterly**: System audits (comprehensive health review, performance analysis)
- **Annual**: Full framework review (strategic alignment, optimization)

**Purpose**: Prevent drift and maintain alignment

### 4.3 Quality Enforcement

Leaders use:
- **Manual 31**: QA Checklist (8-step quality gate)
- **Manual 32**: Performance Metrics Framework (6-category scoring)

**Standard**: Outputs remain clear, accurate, and consistent

### 4.4 Drift Correction

If drift is detected:

1. **Identify the source** (team, individual, use case, training gap)
2. **Reference the relevant manual** (Charter, Protocol, Safety)
3. **Correct the output** (revise, clarify, reframe)
4. **Reinforce the rule** (training, examples, standards)

**Critical**: Drift must be corrected quickly to maintain system integrity

---

## 5. Decision-Making Framework

### 5.1 What Leaders Decide

Leaders decide:
- When tasks are complete
- When revisions are needed
- When to restart a task
- When to escalate
- When to update workflows
- When to adjust boundaries

### 5.2 What AI Cannot Decide

AI cannot decide:
- Strategy
- Priorities
- Sensitive interpretations
- Policy changes
- System updates
- Exceptions to rules

**Principle**: AI executes — humans decide.

---

## 6. Update & Maintenance Governance

Updates follow the Maintenance & Update Schedule (Manual 33):

### Update Frequency
- **Weekly**: Small corrections (typos, minor clarifications)
- **Monthly**: Role and workflow updates (new use cases, refined processes)
- **Quarterly**: System-wide recalibration (standards refresh, drift correction)
- **Annual**: Full framework review (strategic realignment, major updates)

### Update Requirements

All updates must be:
- **Documented** (version tracked, changelog maintained)
- **Approved by System Owner** (explicit authorization)
- **Communicated to users** (announced, explained, trained)
- **Reflected in manuals** (documentation updated immediately)

---

## 7. Documentation Governance

### Documentation Standards

All system documents must be:
- **Clear** (unambiguous language, no jargon)
- **Current** (reflects latest system state)
- **Consistent** (aligned across all manuals)
- **Accessible** (available to all users)

## 8. Compliance & Boundary Enforcement

### Non-Negotiable Boundaries

The system must always enforce:
- **Safety rules** (11 prohibited domains from Manual 25)
- **Role boundaries** (authority limits from Manual 26)
- **Escalation rules** (when to redirect from Manual 34)
- **Workflow limits** (task scope from Manual 29)
- **Tone and structure standards** (output quality from Manual 24)

### Boundary Violation Response

If a boundary is crossed:

1. **Correct the output** (immediate revision or reframe)
2. **Clarify the rule** (reference specific manual section)
3. **Reinforce the standard** (user training or reminder)
4. **Document the violation** (track patterns for audit)

**Standard**: Consistency is non-negotiable.

---

## 9. Long-Term Stewardship

### Stewardship Responsibilities

Long-term stewardship includes:
- **Maintaining clarity** (documentation remains unambiguous)
- **Preventing drift** (continuous monitoring and correction)
- **Updating documentation** (manuals reflect current state)
- **Training new users** (onboarding and certification)
