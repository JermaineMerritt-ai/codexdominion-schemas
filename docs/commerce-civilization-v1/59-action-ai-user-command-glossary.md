```

### Pattern 2: Organize → Format → Finalize
```
1. "Organize these notes into sections"
2. "Turn each section into bullet points"
3. "Add headings and spacing"
```

### Pattern 3: Extract → Organize → Expand
```
1. "Extract the key points from this"

- "for the introduction"
- "for the entire document"

### Start with the Verb

**Good:**
