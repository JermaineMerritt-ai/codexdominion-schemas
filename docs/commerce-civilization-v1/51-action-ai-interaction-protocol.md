# ACTION AI SYSTEM INTERACTION PROTOCOL (v1)

**A narrative explanation of how users and AI communicate effectively inside the Action AI system.**

---

## Document Control

**Manual Number:** 51  
**Title:** Action AI System Interaction Protocol  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Effective Date:** January 1, 2026  
**Document Owner:** Action AI Framework  
**Audience:** All users, team leaders, system stewards, new users, training programs  
**Reading Time:** 10-15 minutes  
**Prerequisites:** Manual 49 (System Overview) recommended but not required  

---

## 1. The Purpose of the Protocol

The Interaction Protocol explains how users and AI talk to each other inside the system.

Its goal is simple:  
**Make communication clear, predictable, and productive.**

When both sides follow the protocol, tasks move smoothly, outputs stay aligned, and misunderstandings are rare.

---

## 2. How Communication Works in the System

The system is built on a simple idea:

**Users provide direction.**  
**AI provides execution.**

Users decide **what** needs to be done.  
AI decides **how** to express it clearly and cleanly.

This separation keeps everything stable.

---

## 3. The User's Role

Users guide the system by:

- **Giving clear instructions**
- **Specifying tone or structure when needed**
- **Reviewing drafts**
- **Requesting revisions**
- **Staying within allowed task types**

Users don't need technical knowledge — just clear language.

### Good Examples:

- "Draft a short introduction for this product."
- "Summarize this in five bullet points."
- "Rewrite this to be clearer."

Short, direct instructions work best.

---

## 4. The AI's Role

The AI's job is to:

- **Interpret the request**
- **Follow system rules**
- **Produce a clean draft**
- **Revise when asked**
- **Avoid assumptions**
- **Escalate only when necessary**

### The AI Never:

- Makes decisions
- Interprets sensitive content
- Provides restricted advice
- Adds unnecessary complexity
- Uses emotional or symbolic language unless requested

**It stays within its defined boundaries at all times.**

---

## 5. The Interaction Flow

Every interaction follows the same pattern:

### 5.1 You Give a Request

The AI reads it and identifies the task type.

### 5.2 The AI Interprets the Request

It checks for clarity, boundaries, and tone.

### 5.3 The AI Produces a Draft

Clean, structured, and aligned.

### 5.4 You Review the Draft

You decide what needs to change.

### 5.5 You Request Revisions

Simple commands guide the AI.

### 5.6 The AI Revises Cleanly

No loops. No drift. No confusion.

### 5.7 You Approve the Final Version

The task is complete.

**This flow keeps communication predictable.**

---

## 6. How the AI Asks Questions

The AI only asks a question when:

- The request is ambiguous
- A detail is missing
- The task could be interpreted in multiple ways
- A boundary might be crossed

**And it asks only one question.**

### Examples:

- "What tone would you like?"
- "Should this be a summary or a rewrite?"
- "Which option should I focus on?"

Once clarified, the AI proceeds without further questions.

---

## 7. How Users Request Revisions

Revisions are simple and direct.

### Examples:

- "Shorten this."
- "Expand section 2."
- "Rewrite this in a more professional tone."
- "Organize this into bullet points."
- "Remove anything unnecessary."

**The AI revises cleanly without adding new issues.**

---

## 8. How the AI Handles Boundaries

If a request crosses a boundary, the AI:

1. **Identifies the issue**
2. **Explains the limitation briefly**
3. **Asks for a safe alternative**

This keeps the system predictable and safe.

---

## 9. How to Reset a Conversation

If things feel off:

- "Let's restart. Here's what I need…"
- "Rewrite this to match the original request."
- "Stay within the original scope."

**The system resets instantly and cleanly.**

---

## 10. Why the Protocol Matters

The Interaction Protocol ensures:

- **Clarity**
- **Consistency**
- **Safety**
- **Predictable behavior**
- **Smooth collaboration**
- **Fast revisions**
- **Stable workflows**

**It turns communication into a simple, reliable process.**

---

## 11. The Protocol in One Sentence

**Users give clear instructions.  
AI executes cleanly.  
Both follow the rules.**

That's the entire Interaction Protocol in plain language.

## Visual Summary: The Interaction Protocol

```
USER                        AI                          SYSTEM
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Give Clear Request    →    Interpret & Check         Uses Rules
                           (clarity, boundaries)      & Boundaries

                      ←    Produce Clean Draft        Follows Standards

Review Draft          →    (waiting for feedback)

Request Revision      →    Revise Cleanly            No drift, no loops
                           (focused changes)

Review Again          →    (waiting for feedback)

Approve               →    Task Complete             Workflow ends

                           Ready for next request
```

## Common Communication Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Perfect First Draft (2 interactions)

**User:** "Summarize this report in bullet points."  
**AI:** [Produces clean 5-bullet summary]  
**User:** "Approved."  
**Result:** Task complete.

### Scenario 2: One Revision Needed (3 interactions)

**User:** "Draft an email about the project delay."  
**AI:** [Produces draft email]  
**User:** "Make it shorter and more direct."  
**AI:** [Produces revised, concise version]  
**User:** "Approved."  
**Result:** Task complete.

### Scenario 3: Clarification Needed (3 interactions)

**User:** "Rewrite this section."  
**AI:** "Should I make it shorter or more detailed?"  
**User:** "Make it more detailed."  
**AI:** [Produces expanded version]  
**User:** "Approved."  
**Result:** Task complete.

### Scenario 4: Boundary Crossed (3 interactions)

**User:** "Write a legal disclaimer for this product."  
**AI:** "I cannot draft legal content. Would you like me to draft general product information instead?"  
**User:** "Yes, draft general product information."  
**AI:** [Produces safe alternative]  
**User:** "Approved."  
**Result:** Task complete with safe alternative.

## Best Practices for Clear Communication

### For Users:

1. **Start with action verbs** ("Draft…" "Summarize…" "Rewrite…")
2. **Be specific** (provide context, length, tone when relevant)
3. **One request at a time** (don't combine multiple tasks)
4. **Review before approving** (catch issues early)
5. **Request revisions clearly** (say exactly what to change)
6. **Stay within allowed task types** (avoid restricted domains)
7. **Reset if stuck** (start over rather than looping)

### For AI:

1. **Interpret accurately** (understand the request before creating)
2. **Follow boundaries** (never cross restricted domains)
3. **Produce clean drafts** (structured, formatted, complete)
4. **Revise focused** (change only what was requested)
5. **Ask minimal questions** (only when truly needed, one at a time)
6. **Never add complexity** (keep outputs simple and direct)
7. **Respect the flow** (Request → Draft → Review → Revise → Finalize)

## Troubleshooting Communication Issues

### Issue 1: AI Misunderstood the Request

**What happened:** Draft doesn't match what you wanted.  
**Solution:** Request a revision with clearer instructions.  
**Example:** "Rewrite this to focus on the benefits, not features."

### Issue 2: Output Too Long or Too Short

**What happened:** Length doesn't meet your needs.  
**Solution:** Give specific length guidance.  
**Example:** "Shorten this to 3 paragraphs" or "Expand this to include more detail."

### Issue 3: Tone Feels Off

**What happened:** Writing style doesn't match your needs.  
**Solution:** Request tone adjustment.  
**Example:** "Make this more professional" or "Use simpler language."

### Issue 4: AI Asked Too Many Questions

**What happened:** Multiple clarification questions instead of producing draft.  
**Solution:** This shouldn't happen (protocol violation). Reset and provide complete initial request.  
**Example:** "Let's restart. Draft a summary of this report in 5 bullet points, professional tone."

### Issue 5: Revision Created New Issues

**What happened:** Revision fixed one thing but broke another.  
**Solution:** Request focused fix or reset.  
**Example:** "Keep the original structure but make section 2 shorter" or "Let's restart."

### Issue 6: Communication Feels Stuck

**What happened:** Multiple revisions not getting closer to goal.  
**Solution:** Reset conversation with complete request.  
**Example:** "Let's start over. Here's exactly what I need: [complete description]."
