## **1. How to Give Effective Instructions (5 minutes)**

Effective instructions get you better results with fewer revisions. Follow these three principles.

### **1.1 Keep Requests Clear and Direct**

**Principle:** Say exactly what you want. Don't ask for help; ask for output.

✅ **Good:**  
"Create a checklist for launching a new product."

❌ **Not Good:**  
"Help me with this."  
"Can you do something about launching products?"  
"I need assistance with product stuff."

**Why This Works:**  
Clear requests tell AI exactly what to produce. Vague requests trigger escalation or guesswork.

**Practice:**  
Transform this vague request into a clear one:  
❌ "I need something for customers."  
✅ ___________________________________

*(Answer: "Write a welcome email for new customers.")*

---

### **1.2 Add Details When They Matter**

**Principle:** Include format, length, tone, or audience if it affects the output.

✅ **Good:**  
"Write a short, professional email introducing our new course."  
*(Details: short, professional, introducing course)*

❌ **Missing Details:**  
"Write an email."  
*(AI has to guess: long or short? formal or casual? about what?)*

**When to Add Details:**
- **Format:** "as bullet points," "with headings," "as a table"
- **Length:** "in 3 sentences," "one page," "100 words"
- **Tone:** "professional," "casual," "friendly," "formal"
- **Audience:** "for customers," "for executives," "for beginners"

**Practice:**  
Add useful details to this request:  
❌ "Create a product description."  
✅ ___________________________________

*(Example Answer: "Create a short, friendly product description for digital planners aimed at busy parents.")*

---

### **1.3 Use Action Verbs**

**Principle:** Start with clear action verbs that produce predictable results.

**Top 10 Action Verbs:**
1. **Draft** → Creates first version (not polished)
2. **Write** → Produces finished content
3. **Summarize** → Condenses to essentials
4. **Organize** → Restructures into format
5. **Compare** → Side-by-side analysis
6. **Rewrite** → Improves existing content
7. **List** → Numbered or bulleted sequence
8. **Create** → Makes something new
9. **Expand** → Adds detail
10. **Shorten** → Reduces length

**Example Requests:**
- "Draft a social media post about our holiday sale."
- "Summarize this meeting transcript in 5 bullets."
- "Organize these customer requests by priority."
- "Rewrite this email to be more professional."

**Practice:**  
Pick the right verb:  
- I need a first version of a blog post → Use "________"
- I need this long email made shorter → Use "________"
- I need these ideas put into categories → Use "________"

*(Answers: Draft, Shorten, Organize)*

---

## **2. What Action AI Can Do (3 minutes)**

Action AI supports **five core task types**. If your request fits one of these, the system can handle it.

### **2.1 Content Creation**
**What:** Producing new text, outlines, scripts, descriptions, emails.  
**Examples:**
- "Draft a product description for a yoga mat."
- "Write a welcome email for new customers."
- "Create an outline for a 4-week training program."

### **2.2 Structuring & Organization**
**What:** Organizing content into checklists, folders, templates, frameworks.  
**Examples:**
- "Create a checklist for onboarding new employees."
- "Build a folder structure for client projects."
- "Organize these ideas into a content calendar."

### **2.3 Optimization**
**What:** Improving existing content (clarity, tone, length, structure).  
**Examples:**
- "Rewrite this to be clearer."
- "Make this more concise."
- "Improve the tone to be more professional."

### **2.4 Analysis**
**What:** Extracting insights, comparing options, summarizing information.  
**Examples:**
- "Summarize this report in 3 bullets."
- "Compare these two pricing models."
- "Identify the key points in this feedback."

### **2.5 Execution**
**What:** Assembling final versions, combining pieces, preparing deliverables.  
**Examples:**
- "Assemble this into a final document."
- "Combine these sections into one report."
- "Prepare a clean version of this proposal."

**Quick Check:**  
Which task type does this request fit?  
"Create a step-by-step guide for setting up email automation."

*(Answer: Structuring & Organization + Content Creation)*

---

## **3. What Action AI Cannot Do (2 minutes)**

To keep the system safe, predictable, and high-quality, Action AI **cannot** do the following.

### **3.1 Make Strategic Decisions**
❌ **Cannot:** "Should we expand into Europe or Asia?"  
✅ **Can:** "Compare the pros and cons of expanding into Europe vs. Asia."

**Why:** Strategic decisions require human judgment, context, and authority.

### **3.2 Provide Legal, Medical, or Financial Advice**
❌ **Cannot:** "Is this contract legally binding?"  
❌ **Cannot:** "What should I invest in?"  
✅ **Can:** "Summarize the key terms in this contract." *(informational, not advice)*

**Why:** These domains require licensed professionals.

### **3.3 Interpret Sensitive Content**
❌ **Cannot:** Make judgments about personal, cultural, or political content.  
✅ **Can:** Organize, summarize, or reformat neutral content.

**Why:** Interpretation requires human nuance and accountability.

### **3.4 Use Emotional or Symbolic Language (Unless Requested)**
❌ **Cannot:** Add ceremonial, poetic, or symbolic language without permission.  
✅ **Can:** Use ceremonial language if explicitly requested: "Write this in a ceremonial tone."

**Why:** Default output is clear, professional, and predictable.

### **3.5 Act Autonomously**
❌ **Cannot:** Execute actions without approval (send emails, publish content, make purchases).  
✅ **Can:** Draft content for you to review and approve.

**Why:** All actions require human oversight.

**What Happens If You Cross a Boundary?**  
The AI will escalate with a message like:  
*"This request requires a strategic decision. Please clarify: [specific question]."*

You can then reframe your request or provide the needed information.

---

## **4. How Tasks Flow Through the System (5 minutes)**

Every task follows the same **6-stage lifecycle**. Understanding this flow helps you know what to expect at each step.

### **4.1 Request**
**What Happens:** You give a clear instruction using an action verb + details.  
**Example:** "Create a checklist for onboarding new customers."  
**Your Role:** Provide clear, direct request.

### **4.2 Processing**
**What Happens:** AI interprets the task, selects the appropriate role (automatically), and prepares output.  
**Example:** System routes to "Documentation & Structuring" role for checklist creation.  
**Your Role:** Wait briefly while AI processes.

**Note:** You don't choose the AI role. The system assigns tasks to specialized roles automatically:
- **Creator Support** → Product creation, digital assets
- **Commerce Operations** → E-commerce, sales, revenue tasks
- **Content & Marketing** → Social media, emails, campaigns
- **Documentation & Structuring** → Checklists, frameworks, organization
- **Intelligence & Insights** → Analysis, summaries, comparisons

### **4.3 Output**
**What Happens:** AI delivers a clean, structured result aligned with your request.  
**Example:** A numbered checklist with 8 onboarding steps.  
**Your Role:** Review the output.

### **4.4 Review**
**What Happens:** You evaluate whether the output meets your needs.  
**Your Options:**
- ✅ **Approve:** Output is good → Task complete
- 🔄 **Revise:** Output needs adjustment → Go to Revision stage
- ❌ **Reject:** Output is completely wrong → Reset task (see Section 6)

**Your Role:** Decide whether to approve, revise, or reset.

### **4.5 Revision (If Needed)**
**What Happens:** You request specific changes using clear revision commands.  
**Example:** "Shorten this to 5 steps" or "Add estimated time for each step."  
**Your Role:** Use simple, direct revision commands (see Section 5).

**Best Practice:** 2-3 revision cycles maximum before resetting.

### **4.6 Completion**
**What Happens:** Task is marked complete and archived for reference.  
**Example:** Approved checklist is saved and ready for use.  
**Your Role:** Use the final output confidently.

**Lifecycle Flowchart:**
```
Request → Processing → Output → Review
                                   ↓
                         ┌─────────┴─────────┐
                         ↓                   ↓
                      Approve            Revise
                         ↓                   ↓
                    Completion         Processing
                                           ↓
                                        Output
                                           ↓
                                        Review
```

**Practice:**  
You requested "Write a product description" and received output that's too long.  
Which stage are you in? ____________  
What should you do next? ____________

*(Answers: Review stage, Go to Revision stage with command "Make this more concise.")*

---

## **5. How to Request Revisions (3 minutes)**

Revisions work best when you use **simple, direct commands** that tell AI exactly what to change.

### **5.1 Top Revision Commands**

**Length Adjustments:**
- "Shorten this." *(general)*
- "Shorten this to 50 words." *(specific)*
- "Expand section 2." *(add detail)*

**Tone Adjustments:**
- "Rewrite this in a more professional tone."
- "Make this warmer."
- "Make this more casual."

**Structure Adjustments:**
- "Organize this into bullet points."
- "Format this with headings."
- "Turn this into a checklist."

**Content Adjustments:**
- "Remove anything unnecessary."
- "Add examples to section 3."
- "Focus only on pricing, ignore features."

**Clarity Adjustments:**
- "Rewrite this to be clearer."
- "Simplify the language."
- "Make this easier to understand."

### **5.2 Revision Best Practices**

**Do:**
- ✅ Be specific: "Shorten to 3 bullets" beats "Make this shorter."
- ✅ Address one thing at a time: "Make this more concise" before "Change the tone."
- ✅ Limit to 2-3 revision cycles before resetting.

**Don't:**
- ❌ Say "That's not right" without explaining why.
- ❌ Mix multiple requests: "Make it shorter and change the tone and add examples and remove section 2."
- ❌ Keep revising past 3 cycles (reset instead).

### **5.3 Example Revision Flow**

**Request:** "Write a welcome email for new customers."

**Output (V1):**  
*(300-word email with formal tone)*

**Revision 1:** "Shorten this to 100 words."  
**Output (V2):**  
*(100-word email, still formal tone)*

**Revision 2:** "Make the tone warmer and friendlier."  
**Output (V3):**  
*(100-word email, friendly tone)*

**Approve:** ✅ Task complete.

**Practice:**  
The output is too technical for your audience. What revision command do you use?  
___________________________________

*(Example Answer: "Rewrite this in simpler language for beginners.")*

## **6. How to Troubleshoot Issues (5 minutes)**

When outputs feel off, use these **quick fixes** to get back on track.

### **6.1 If the Output Feels Off (Wrong Focus)**

**Symptom:** Output doesn't match your original request.

**Quick Fix:**  
"Rewrite this to match the original request."  
OR  
"Focus only on [specific element], ignore [unwanted element]."

**Example:**  
❌ Request: "Create a product description."  
Output: Product description + pricing details + shipping policy *(too much)*

✅ Fix: "Focus only on the product description, ignore pricing and shipping."

---

### **6.2 If the Output Is Too Long**

**Symptom:** Content is wordy or exceeds desired length.

**Quick Fix:**  
"Make this more concise."  
OR  
"Shorten this to [X] words/bullets/sentences."

**Example:**  
❌ Output: 500-word email  
✅ Fix: "Shorten this to 150 words."

---

### **6.3 If the Tone Feels Wrong**

**Symptom:** Tone is too formal, too casual, too technical, or doesn't match audience.

**Quick Fix:**  
"Rewrite this in a [tone] tone."

**Tone Options:**
- Professional
- Casual
- Friendly
- Formal
- Simple
- Technical
- Warm
- Direct

**Example:**  
❌ Output: Very formal email for casual audience  
✅ Fix: "Rewrite this in a friendly, casual tone."

---

### **6.4 If the AI Asks Too Many Questions**

**Symptom:** AI escalates unnecessarily or asks questions when you think it has enough information.

**Quick Fix:**  
"You have enough information — proceed."  
OR  
Provide one clarifying detail (format, audience, or length).

**Example:**  
AI asks: "Do you want this in bullet points or paragraphs?"  
✅ Fix: "Use bullet points."

**When to Answer Questions:**  
If the question is about something you care about (format, tone, audience) → Answer it.  
If the question feels unnecessary → Override with "You have enough information — proceed."

---

### **6.5 If the AI Misinterprets the Task**

**Symptom:** Output is completely wrong or doesn't address your request.

**Quick Fix:**  
"Let's restart. Here's what I need: [clear, specific request]."

**Example:**  
❌ Request: "Create a checklist for launching a product."  
Output: Essay about product launch strategies *(wrong format)*

✅ Fix: "Let's restart. Here's what I need: A numbered checklist with 10 steps for launching a digital product."

---

### **6.6 Quick Troubleshooting Checklist**

If output isn't working after one fix, follow this sequence:

1. ☐ Clarify the request ("Focus only on X")
2. ☐ Specify tone ("Rewrite in professional tone")
3. ☐ Specify length ("Shorten to X words")
4. ☐ Specify structure ("Format as bullet points")
5. ☐ Ask for rewrite ("Rewrite to match original request")
6. ☐ Reset task ("Let's restart. Here's what I need…")

**Most issues resolve by step 3.**

---

## **7. Best Practices for Teams (5 minutes)**

These practices ensure consistent, high-quality results across your team.

### **7.1 Start With Drafts**

**Principle:** Don't aim for perfection on the first try.

**How:**  
Use "Draft…" for first versions, then refine:  
- "Draft a product description."
- Review output
- "Make this more concise."
- "Improve the tone to be friendlier."

**Why This Works:**  
Drafts give you a starting point to improve, saving time compared to starting from scratch.

---

### **7.2 Build in Layers**

**Principle:** Break complex tasks into steps.

**How:**  
Instead of: "Create a complete sales page with headline, features, benefits, pricing, and FAQ."

Try:  
1. "Create an outline for a sales page."
2. "Draft the headline and opening paragraph."
3. "List the top 5 product features."
4. "Rewrite features as customer benefits."
5. "Assemble this into a final sales page."

**Why This Works:**  
Layered building gives you control at each stage and produces better final results.

---

### **7.3 Keep Instructions Simple**

**Principle:** Short, direct requests work best.

**How:**  
✅ Good: "Create a checklist for onboarding."  
❌ Too Complex: "Help me think through how we might approach creating some kind of guide or process documentation for bringing new people into the organization in a structured way."

**Why This Works:**  
Simple requests reduce ambiguity and escalation.

---

### **7.4 Use the Glossary**

**Principle:** Tested commands produce predictable results.

**How:**  
Reference **Manual 38 (User Command Glossary)** for proven commands:
- Draft…
- Summarize…
- Organize this into…
- Create a checklist for…
- Rewrite this to be clearer…
- Compare these two options…

**Why This Works:**  
Glossary commands have been refined to minimize revision cycles.

---

### **7.5 Give Feedback**

**Principle:** The system improves with your guidance.

**How:**  
If outputs consistently miss the mark:
- Note the pattern ("AI always adds too much detail")
- Share feedback with your team lead or trainer
- Adjust your request phrasing ("Keep this brief")

**Why This Works:**  
Feedback helps the team refine workflows and improve consistency.

---

### **Team Standards Checklist**

Use this checklist for team consistency:

☐ All requests start with action verbs  
☐ Format/length/tone specified when relevant  
☐ Revisions use simple commands  
☐ Maximum 2-3 revision cycles before reset  
☐ Glossary commands used for common tasks  
☐ Feedback shared when patterns emerge  
☐ New team members complete this 30-minute training
