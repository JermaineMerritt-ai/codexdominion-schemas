## 2. Maintenance Frequency Overview

### 2.1 The 4-Cycle Maintenance System

Your AI operations system operates on four distinct maintenance cycles, each with specific focus and responsibilities:

| Cycle | Frequency | Duration | Focus | Primary Goal |
|-------|-----------|----------|-------|--------------|
| **Weekly** | Every Monday | 30-60 min | Light checks, minor corrections | Keep system sharp |
| **Monthly** | Last week of month | 2-4 hours | Role-specific reviews, document refresh | Prevent drift |
| **Quarterly** | End of quarter | 1-2 days | System-wide audit, recalibration | Maintain stability |
| **Annual** | End of year | 3-5 days | Full framework review, modernization | Future-ready system |

### 2.2 Cycle Priorities

**Reactive Cycles** (respond to issues):
- Weekly: Address immediate concerns
- Event-Triggered: Rapid adaptation to changes

**Proactive Cycles** (prevent issues):
- Monthly: Systematic role maintenance
- Quarterly: System-level alignment
- Annual: Strategic evolution

### 2.3 Maintenance Philosophy
- **Predictable**: Scheduled rhythm prevents surprise interventions
- **Incremental**: Small regular updates vs. large disruptive changes
- **Transparent**: All changes documented and communicated
- **Reversible**: Updates can be rolled back if needed
- **Measured**: Performance tracking validates maintenance effectiveness

**Principle 1: Incremental Over Disruptive**
- Make small frequent updates vs. large infrequent ones
- Test changes with limited scope before full rollout
- Allow adaptation time between major updates

**Principle 2: Communicate Clearly**
- Announce updates before implementation
- Explain reasons for changes
- Provide examples of new standards
- Allow questions and clarifications

**Principle 3: Document Thoroughly**
- Record all changes in maintenance logs
- Include rationale and expected outcomes
- Document rollback procedures
- Track effectiveness over time

**Principle 4: Test Before Deploying**
- Validate changes with sample outputs
- Test with one agent before all agents
- Monitor closely post-implementation
- Be ready to revert if issues arise

**Principle 5: Learn and Iterate**
- Analyze what works and what doesn't
- Refine maintenance processes themselves
- Share lessons learned
- Continuously improve the system

### 11.2 Common Maintenance Mistakes to Avoid

**Mistake 1: Over-Maintenance**
- Changing too frequently creates instability
- Agents need time to adapt to updates
- **Solution**: Stick to the schedule, minimize event-triggered updates

**Mistake 2: Under-Documentation**
- Undocumented changes create confusion
- Difficult to track what was changed when
- **Solution**: Use templates, maintain master log

**Mistake 3: No Testing**
- Deploying untested changes causes problems
- Difficult to identify source of issues
- **Solution**: Always test before full deployment

**Mistake 4: Ignoring Feedback**
- User concerns indicate real issues
- Agent confusion signals unclear updates
- **Solution**: Actively solicit and incorporate feedback

**Mistake 5: Reactive Only**
- Waiting for problems instead of preventing
- Creates firefighting culture
- **Solution**: Follow proactive maintenance cycles

**Mistake 6: No Rollback Plan**
- Failed updates with no recovery option
- System instability if changes don't work
- **Solution**: Always define rollback procedure

## 13. Troubleshooting Maintenance Issues

### 13.1 Issue: Maintenance Schedule Too Demanding

**Symptoms**: Can't complete maintenance tasks on schedule, feeling overwhelmed.

**Solutions:**
1. **Prioritize critical cycles**: Focus on compliance/safety checks, defer non-critical reviews
2. **Adjust frequencies**: Extend weekly to bi-weekly if system stable
3. **Streamline processes**: Use checklists, reduce documentation burden
4. **Delegate tasks**: Distribute maintenance responsibilities across team
5. **Automate where possible**: Use tools to track performance, flag issues

---

### 13.2 Issue: Updates Causing Instability

**Symptoms**: Agent performance declines after updates, confusion increases.

**Solutions:**
1. **Slow down update pace**: Allow more adaptation time between changes
2. **Test more thoroughly**: Validate with limited scope before full deployment
3. **Improve communication**: Explain changes more clearly with examples
4. **Provide training**: Don't assume agents understand updates without guidance
5. **Have rollback plan**: Be ready to revert if update causes problems

---

### 13.3 Issue: Documentation Falling Behind

**Symptoms**: Changes made but not documented, unclear what was updated.

**Solutions:**
1. **Use templates**: Make documentation easier with pre-formatted logs
2. **Document immediately**: Update logs as part of update process, not after
3. **Assign responsibility**: Make documentation someone's explicit job
4. **Set minimums**: At minimum, log date, change, reason, next review
5. **Audit documentation**: Include doc completeness in quarterly reviews

---

### 13.4 Issue: Agents Not Following Updates

**Symptoms**: Agents continue old behaviors despite update notifications.

**Solutions:**
1. **Verify communication**: Confirm agents received and understood updates
2. **Provide examples**: Show correct vs. incorrect application of new rules
3. **Test understanding**: Use practice scenarios to verify comprehension
4. **Monitor closely**: Check every output until new behavior confirmed
5. **Reinforce repeatedly**: Some changes need multiple reinforcements

---

### 13.5 Issue: Maintenance Not Preventing Drift

**Symptoms**: Drift continues despite regular maintenance.

**Solutions:**
1. **Increase frequency**: Move to more frequent checks if needed
2. **Deepen reviews**: Look beyond surface to identify root causes
3. **Strengthen baselines**: Establish clearer reference standards
4. **Improve feedback**: Make corrections more specific and actionable
5. **Review governance**: May need structural changes (Manual 29)
