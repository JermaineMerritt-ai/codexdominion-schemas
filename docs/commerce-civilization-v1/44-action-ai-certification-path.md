**What Action AI Cannot Do:**
- Make strategic decisions or recommendations
- Interpret sensitive content (personal, cultural, political)
- Provide licensed professional advice (legal, medical, financial)
- Add complexity without permission
- Use emotional language unless requested

**Reference:** Manual 35 (Master Handbook), Manual 42 (System Overview Deck)

---

#### **2. Basic Command Vocabulary**

**Essential Action Verbs:**
- **Draft** – First version, needs refinement
- **Write** – Polished version, ready to use
- **Summarize** – Condense to essentials
- **Organize** – Restructure into specific format
- **Rewrite** – Improve existing content
- **Create** – Build structured deliverable

**Command Formula:**  
Action Verb + What You Want + Key Details

**Examples:**
- "Draft a 150-word product description."
- "Summarize this report in 5 bullet points."
- "Organize this into numbered steps."

**Reference:** Manual 38 (User Command Glossary)

---

#### **3. Clear Instruction Principles**

**Principle 1: Be Specific**
- ❌ "Help me with an email."
- ✅ "Write a 100-word professional email announcing our product launch."

**Principle 2: Set Constraints**
- ❌ "Write a product description."
- ✅ "Write a 150-word product description for busy professionals."

**Principle 3: Use Action Verbs**
- ❌ "I need something for social media."
- ✅ "Draft 3 Instagram captions for our new product (50 words each)."

**Reference:** Manual 39 (Team Training Module)

---

#### **4. Simple Revision Requests**

**When Output Needs Adjustment:**

**Too Long:**  
"Make this more concise." or "Shorten to 100 words."

**Wrong Tone:**  
"Rewrite in a professional tone." or "Rewrite in a friendly tone."

**Wrong Focus:**  
"Focus only on customer benefits." or "Remove technical details."

**Reference:** Manual 37 (Troubleshooting Guide)

---

#### **5. Avoiding Ambiguity**

**Common Sources of Ambiguity:**
- Missing length constraints
- Unspecified tone
- Unclear audience
- Vague action verbs ("help," "fix," "improve")
- Multiple requests in one command

**Clarity Checklist:**
- □ Action verb specified?
- □ What I want clearly stated?
- □ Length/format defined?
