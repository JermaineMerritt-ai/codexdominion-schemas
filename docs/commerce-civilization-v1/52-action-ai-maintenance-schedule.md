## 1. Why Maintenance Matters

The Action AI system is designed to feel stable and predictable.

To keep it that way, it needs regular check-ins — not because it breaks, but because clarity, consistency, and alignment naturally drift over time.

### This Schedule Ensures:

- **Outputs stay consistent**
- **Tone remains stable**
- **Boundaries stay enforced**
- **Workflows remain predictable**
- **Documentation stays current**
- **Teams stay aligned**

**Think of it like routine maintenance for a well-running machine.**

---

## 2. The Four Maintenance Rhythms

The system stays healthy through four rhythms:

- **Weekly**
- **Monthly**
- **Quarterly**
- **Annual**

Each rhythm has a different purpose and level of depth.

---

## 3. Weekly Maintenance

**Weekly maintenance is light and fast.**  
It's about catching small issues before they grow.

### What Happens Weekly

- Quick spot checks of recent outputs
- Checking for tone drift
- Checking for structural drift
- Confirming boundaries are being followed
- Noting any recurring user issues

### Why It Matters

**Weekly checks keep the system feeling consistent day-to-day.**

### Who Does It

- Team Leaders
- Time required: 15-30 minutes
- Sample size: 5-10 recent outputs

### Weekly Checklist

1. **Review Recent Outputs** - Pull 5-10 recent outputs across different task types
2. **Scan for Tone Drift** - Does tone feel consistent with system standards?
3. **Check Structure** - Are formatting patterns being followed?
4. **Verify Boundaries** - Any signs of restricted domain crossing?
5. **Note User Issues** - Are users reporting confusion or unexpected behavior?
6. **Document Quick Findings** - 3-5 bullet summary of any concerns
7. **Escalate If Needed** - Alert System Steward or Implementation Lead if issues found

### What Gets Reported

- Quick summary (3-5 bullets)

## Troubleshooting Maintenance Issues

### Issue 1: Maintenance Falling Behind

**What happened:** Scheduled checks not happening consistently.  
**Solution:** Reduce frequency or scope until sustainable, then gradually increase. Better to do monthly checks consistently than skip quarterly audits.  
**Prevention:** Build maintenance into work calendars, assign clear ownership, reduce scope if team capacity changes.

### Issue 2: Too Many Issues Found

**What happened:** Maintenance reveals overwhelming drift or problems.  
**Solution:** Prioritize by severity (Critical → High → Medium → Low), address critical immediately, schedule others for monthly/quarterly correction.  
**Prevention:** More frequent checks catch issues earlier when easier to fix.

### Issue 3: Updates Not Being Adopted

**What happened:** Changes documented but users still following old patterns.  
**Solution:** Increase communication (team meetings, email reminders, 1-on-1 coaching), add examples showing new way, provide practice exercises.  
**Prevention:** Over-communicate changes, make adoption easy with clear before/after examples, get user buy-in before implementing.

### Issue 4: Unclear What to Update

**What happened:** Know something's wrong but not sure what manual to change.  
**Solution:** Use Manual Index (Manual 35) to identify affected manuals, consult with System Owner or Steward, review related manuals for context.  
**Prevention:** Better issue documentation during weekly/monthly checks, track symptoms and root causes separately.

### Issue 5: Maintenance Taking Too Long

**What happened:** Scheduled maintenance consistently exceeds time estimates.  
**Solution:** Focus on highest-value checks first, use sampling strategies (random selection rather than reviewing all outputs), consider delegating to multiple Team Leaders.  
**Prevention:** Right-size sample sizes for available time, use templates for faster reporting, train Team Leaders to be more efficient.
