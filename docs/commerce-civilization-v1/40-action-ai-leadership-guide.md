## **1. Leadership Overview**

### **Purpose of This Guide**

This guide teaches leaders how to manage, oversee, and optimize the Action AI workforce for consistent, high-quality results.

**Leadership Role Definition:**  
Leaders provide **judgment, strategy, and oversight**. The AI workforce handles **execution, drafting, and revision**. This division ensures efficiency while maintaining quality and alignment.

**Leaders Are Responsible For:**
- ✓ **Setting Direction** → Define clear goals, objectives, and constraints
- ✓ **Maintaining Clarity** → Ensure instructions are unambiguous
- ✓ **Ensuring Alignment** → Keep AI outputs aligned with system rules and business goals
- ✓ **Enforcing Boundaries** → Prevent scope creep and rule violations
- ✓ **Reviewing Outputs** → Evaluate quality against standards
- ✓ **Guiding Improvements** → Provide actionable feedback for revisions

**AI Workforce Is Responsible For:**
- Executing tasks within defined scope
- Following all system rules and protocols
- Staying within boundaries
- Revising cleanly based on feedback
- Escalating when clarity is needed

**Leadership Philosophy:**  
Effective leadership of AI agents is about **clarity, consistency, and boundaries**—not control or micromanagement. Leaders who master these three principles get predictable, high-quality results.

---

## **2. Leadership Responsibilities**

### **2.1 Define Clear Goals**

**Principle:** AI performs best when leaders articulate exactly what success looks like.

**What Leaders Should Specify:**

**1. The Objective**  
What are you trying to achieve?  
✅ Good: "Create a welcome email for new customers that explains our onboarding process."  
❌ Too Vague: "Do something with customer onboarding."

**2. The Format**  
What structure should the output have?  
- Bullet points, numbered list, paragraphs, table, checklist, outline
- Example: "Organize this as a checklist with 10 steps."

**3. The Audience**  
Who is this for?  
- Customers, internal team, executives, beginners, experts
- Example: "Write this for busy parents with no technical background."

**4. The Constraints**  
What boundaries apply?  
- **Tone:** Professional, casual, friendly, formal, warm, direct
- **Length:** 100 words, 3 sentences, one page, brief summary
- **Structure:** With headings, as bullet points, in table format
- **Content Limits:** Focus only on X, ignore Y, exclude Z

**Example of Clear Goal-Setting:**

❌ **Unclear:**  
"Help with product descriptions."

✅ **Clear:**  
"Write a 150-word product description for our digital planner aimed at busy professionals. Use a professional but friendly tone. Include 3 key benefits and a call-to-action."

**Why This Matters:**  
Clear goals reduce revision cycles, prevent drift, and improve output quality. Vague goals trigger escalation, guesswork, and misalignment.

**Leader Checkpoint:**  
Before giving any task, ask yourself:
- ☐ Is my objective clear?
- ☐ Have I specified the format?
- ☐ Have I defined the audience?
- ☐ Have I set constraints (tone/length/structure)?

---

### **2.2 Maintain System Alignment**

**Principle:** AI agents follow a documented rule system. Leaders ensure outputs stay aligned with those rules.

**Core System Documents:**

| **Manual** | **Purpose** | **Leader Use Case** |
|------------|-------------|---------------------|
| **21 - Operating Charter** | Mission and authority | Reference when AI refuses valid tasks or accepts invalid ones |
| **25 - Safety & Compliance** | 11 restricted domains | Reference when AI approaches boundaries |
| **26 - Role Definitions** | 5 agent roles and their tasks | Reference when task routing feels wrong |
| **27 - Interaction Protocol** | 8 communication rules | Reference when AI communication feels off |
| **29 - Workflow Map** | 8 task patterns | Reference when workflow doesn't match expected pattern |
| **31 - Quality Assurance Checklist** | 8-step pre-delivery gate | Use to evaluate any output before approval |

**How to Maintain Alignment:**

**Step 1: Know the Rules**  
Leaders should be familiar with these 6 core manuals. You don't need to memorize them, but you should know where to look.

**Step 2: Spot Misalignment Early**  
Common signs of drift:
- Output includes content you didn't request
- Tone shifts from professional to casual (or vice versa)
- Structure doesn't match your request
- AI refuses valid tasks or accepts invalid ones
- Output feels "off" but you can't pinpoint why

**Step 3: Reference the Manuals**  
When output feels wrong, consult:
- **Manual 31 (QA Checklist)** → Run the 8-step quality gate
- **Manual 25 (Safety & Compliance)** → Check if boundaries were violated
- **Manual 27 (Interaction Protocol)** → Check if communication rules were followed

**Step 4: Correct the Misalignment**  
Use direct feedback:
- "Stay within the original request."
- "Follow the professional tone standard from the protocol."
- "Remove any content outside the scope I defined."

**Example Scenario:**

**Task:** "Write a product description."  
**Output:** Product description + pricing details + shipping policy + customer testimonials *(drift beyond scope)*

**Leader Action:**  
"Focus only on the product description. Remove pricing, shipping, and testimonials."

**Why This Matters:**  
Alignment ensures consistency, predictability, and trust in the system. Drift creates confusion and requires rework.

**Leader Checkpoint:**  
When reviewing outputs, ask:
- ☐ Does this match my original request?
- ☐ Does this follow the tone/length/structure I specified?
- ☐ Does this stay within allowed boundaries?
- ☐ Does this match previous outputs for consistency?

---

### **2.3 Enforce Boundaries**

**Principle:** Boundaries keep the system safe, predictable, and high-quality. Leaders must actively enforce them.

**Core Boundaries (From Manual 25 - Safety & Compliance):**

**1. No Strategic Decisions**  
AI cannot make business, strategic, or judgment-based decisions.  
❌ "Should we expand into Europe or Asia?"  
✅ "Compare the pros and cons of expanding into Europe vs. Asia."

**2. No Legal/Medical/Financial Advice**  
AI cannot provide licensed professional advice.  
❌ "Is this contract legally binding?"  
✅ "Summarize the key terms in this contract." *(informational only)*

**3. No Sensitive Content Interpretation**  
AI cannot interpret personal, cultural, or political content.  
❌ "Is this customer complaint justified?"  
✅ "Summarize the customer's complaint in 3 bullets."

**4. No Emotional or Symbolic Language (Unless Requested)**  
AI defaults to clear, professional language.  
❌ AI adds poetic language without permission  
✅ AI uses plain, professional language by default

**5. No Autonomous Action**  
AI cannot execute actions without approval (send emails, publish content, make purchases).  
❌ "Send this email to the customer."  
✅ "Draft this email for my review."

**How Leaders Enforce Boundaries:**

**Prevention (Best):**  
Frame requests within boundaries from the start.  
✅ "Draft a proposal comparing option A and option B."  
❌ "Which option should we choose?"

**Detection (When Needed):**  
Spot boundary violations in outputs:
- AI made a recommendation instead of providing options
- AI interpreted sensitive content instead of summarizing
- AI used ceremonial language without request

**Correction (When Necessary):**  
Use direct feedback:
- "Stay within informational scope—don't make recommendations."
- "Remove interpretive language, just summarize the facts."
- "Rewrite in plain, professional language."

**Escalation (When Required):**  
If AI repeatedly violates boundaries:
1. Reset the task: "Let's restart. Here's what I need…"
2. Reference Manual 25: "Follow the Safety & Compliance rules from Manual 25."
3. Report persistent issues to system governance for review

**Example Scenario:**

**Task:** "Analyze this customer feedback."  
**Output:** "This customer is clearly frustrated and overreacting. They probably just had a bad day." *(interpretation + judgment)*

**Leader Action:**  
"Remove interpretive language. Just summarize what the customer said in neutral terms."

**Why This Matters:**  
Boundaries ensure AI operates safely, predictably, and within its designed capabilities. Violations create risk and erode trust.

**Leader Checkpoint:**  
When reviewing outputs, ask:
- ☐ Did AI stay within informational scope (no strategic decisions)?
- ☐ Did AI avoid licensed professional advice (legal/medical/financial)?
- ☐ Did AI stay neutral on sensitive content (no interpretation)?
- ☐ Did AI use appropriate language (professional unless requested otherwise)?
- ☐ Did AI wait for approval before action?

---

### **2.4 Guide Revisions**

**Principle:** AI revises cleanly when feedback is clear, direct, and actionable.

**Effective Revision Commands:**

**Length Adjustments:**
- "Shorten this." *(general)*
- "Shorten this to 100 words." *(specific)*
- "Expand section 3." *(add detail)*
- "Give me a brief version." *(high-level summary)*

**Tone Adjustments:**
- "Rewrite this in a more professional tone."
- "Make this warmer and friendlier."
- "Make this more formal."
- "Simplify the language for beginners."

**Structure Adjustments:**
- "Organize this into bullet points."
- "Format this with headings."
- "Turn this into a numbered checklist."
- "Break this into 3 sections."

**Content Adjustments:**
- "Remove anything unnecessary."
- "Add examples to section 2."
- "Focus only on benefits, ignore features."
- "Include pricing details."

**Clarity Adjustments:**
- "Rewrite this to be clearer."
- "Make this easier to understand."
- "Simplify the technical terms."
- "Add transitions between sections."

**Revision Best Practices for Leaders:**

**1. Be Specific**  
✅ "Shorten to 3 bullets" beats "Make this shorter."  
✅ "Rewrite in a casual tone" beats "Change the tone."

**2. Address One Thing at a Time**  
✅ First: "Shorten this to 100 words."  
✅ Then: "Make the tone more professional."  
❌ Don't: "Shorten this and change the tone and add examples and remove section 2."

**3. Limit Revision Cycles**  
- **1-2 revisions:** Normal and expected
- **3 revisions:** Maximum before considering reset
- **4+ revisions:** Reset the task with clearer instructions

**4. Use Positive Language**  
✅ "Add examples to section 2" beats "This needs more detail."  
✅ "Rewrite in a professional tone" beats "This tone is wrong."

**5. Reference Previous Versions**  
If needed: "Rewrite this to match the tone from version 1."

**Example Revision Flow:**

**Request:** "Write a product description."

**Output V1:** *(200 words, formal tone)*

**Revision 1:** "Shorten to 100 words."  
**Output V2:** *(100 words, still formal)*

**Revision 2:** "Make the tone friendlier."  
**Output V3:** *(100 words, friendly tone)*

**Approve:** ✅ Task complete.

**When to Stop Revising:**

**Stop and Reset If:**
- You've done 3+ revisions and it's not improving
- The output is completely wrong (not just needing polish)
- You realize your original request was unclear

**Reset Command:**  
"Let's restart. Here's what I need: [clear, specific request]."

**Why This Matters:**  
Clear revision guidance gets better results with fewer cycles. Vague feedback ("make it better") creates loops and frustration.

**Leader Checkpoint:**  
When requesting revisions, ask:
- ☐ Is my feedback specific?
- ☐ Am I addressing one thing at a time?
- ☐ Have I exceeded 3 revision cycles? (If yes, consider reset)
- ☐ Am I using positive, actionable language?

---

### **2.5 Approve or Retire Tasks**

**Principle:** Leaders decide when tasks are complete, need revision, should be reset, or should be retired.

**Four Possible Outcomes:**

**1. Approve (Task Complete)**  
**When:** Output meets standards and requirements.  
**Action:** Mark task complete and use the output.  
**Example:** "This looks great. Task approved."

**2. Revise (Needs Polish)**  
**When:** Output is good but needs specific adjustments.  
**Action:** Provide clear revision commands (see Section 2.4).  
**Example:** "Shorten to 3 paragraphs and make the tone more professional."

**3. Reset (Needs Fresh Start)**  
**When:** Output is wrong or 3+ revisions haven't worked.  
**Action:** Reset with clearer instructions.  
**Example:** "Let's restart. Here's what I need: a 150-word product description with 3 benefits and a CTA."

**4. Retire (No Longer Needed)**  
**When:** Task is obsolete, replaced, or no longer relevant.  
**Action:** Close task without output.  
**Example:** "This task is no longer needed. Closing."

**Decision Flowchart:**

```
Review Output
     ↓
┌────┴────────────────────────────┐
↓                                 ↓
Meets Standards?           Doesn't Meet Standards
     ↓                                 ↓
  APPROVE                    ┌─────────┴─────────┐
                             ↓                   ↓
                    Minor Adjustments?    Major Issues?
                             ↓                   ↓
                          REVISE              RESET
                    (1-3 cycles max)
```

**When to Approve:**
- ✓ Output matches request
- ✓ Tone/length/structure correct
- ✓ Quality passes QA Checklist (Manual 31)
- ✓ Content within boundaries
- ✓ No errors or inconsistencies

**When to Revise:**
- Small adjustments needed (length, tone, structure)
- Content is good but needs polish
- Minor clarifications required
- You're within 1-3 revision cycles

**When to Reset:**
- Output is completely wrong
- 3+ revisions haven't improved it
- You realize your original request was unclear
- Output drifted too far from intent

**When to Retire:**
- Business priorities changed
- Task replaced by different approach
- Output no longer needed
- Task was exploratory and yielded insights without output

**Example Scenarios:**

**Scenario 1: Approve**  
Task: "Create a 5-step onboarding checklist."  
Output: Clean, numbered list with 5 clear steps.  
Leader: "This looks great. Approved."

**Scenario 2: Revise**  
Task: "Write a welcome email."  
Output: Good content but 300 words (too long).  
Leader: "Shorten to 150 words." → Output revised → Approved.

**Scenario 3: Reset**  
Task: "Draft a product description."  
Output: Essay about product history (wrong format).  
Revision 1: "Make this a description, not an essay." → Still wrong.  
Revision 2: "Focus on benefits." → Still drifting.  
Leader: "Let's restart. I need a 100-word product description with 3 benefits in bullet points."

**Scenario 4: Retire**  
Task: "Compare pricing models A and B."  
Leader: "We've decided to go with model C instead. Retiring this task."

**Why This Matters:**  
Clear decision-making prevents endless revision loops and ensures the AI workforce stays focused on valuable work.

**Leader Checkpoint:**  
When reviewing outputs, decide:
- ☐ Approve? (Meets standards, ready to use)
- ☐ Revise? (Needs polish, within 3 cycles)
- ☐ Reset? (Major issues, exceeded 3 cycles)
- ☐ Retire? (No longer needed)

## **3. How Leaders Get the Best Performance**

### **3.1 Use the Right Commands**

**Principle:** Specific commands produce predictable results. Leaders who master the command glossary get consistent quality.

**Essential Commands from Manual 38 (User Command Glossary):**

**Creation Commands:**
- **"Draft…"** → First version (expect refinement needed)
- **"Write…"** → Polished version (expect minimal revision)
- **"Create an outline for…"** → Structured framework
- **"Generate ideas for…"** → Brainstorming options

**Structuring Commands:**
- **"Organize this into…"** → Restructure format
- **"Create a checklist for…"** → Step-by-step tasks
- **"Summarize…"** → Condense to essentials
- **"Break this into…"** → Divide into parts

**Optimization Commands:**
- **"Rewrite this to be clearer…"** → Improve clarity
- **"Make this more concise…"** → Reduce length
- **"Improve the tone to be…"** → Adjust formality/warmth
- **"Restructure for readability…"** → Better flow

**Analysis Commands:**
- **"Compare these two options…"** → Side-by-side comparison
- **"Identify the key points…"** → Extract main ideas
- **"What's missing from…"** → Spot gaps
- **"Extract insights from…"** → Pull themes/patterns

**Execution Commands:**
- **"Assemble this into a final version…"** → Combine pieces
- **"Prepare a clean version of…"** → Remove drafts/notes
- **"List all the steps for…"** → Sequential workflow
- **"Combine these sections into…"** → Merge content

**Why This Matters:**  
These commands have been tested and refined. Using them consistently gives you predictable, high-quality results.

**Leader Habit:**  
Reference Manual 38 (User Command Glossary) when giving tasks. Pick the exact command that matches your intent.

---

### **3.2 Build in Layers**

**Principle:** Complex outputs are built step-by-step, not all at once.

**The Layer-Building Process:**

**Layer 1: Draft**  
Create the first version (expect it to need refinement).  
Example: "Draft a product launch email."

**Layer 2: Refine**  
Make specific improvements (length, tone, structure).  
Example: "Shorten to 150 words and make the tone more urgent."

**Layer 3: Finalize**  
Polish and prepare for use.  
Example: "Add a call-to-action button and finalize for distribution."

**Example: Building a Sales Page**

**Instead of:**  
"Create a complete sales page with headline, features, benefits, pricing, testimonials, and FAQ."  
*(This overwhelms the AI and produces mediocre results.)*

**Build in Layers:**  
1. "Create an outline for a sales page." → Review outline
2. "Draft the headline and opening paragraph." → Review and refine
3. "List the top 5 product features." → Review list
4. "Rewrite features as customer benefits." → Review benefits
5. "Add pricing section with 3 tiers." → Review pricing
6. "Assemble this into a final sales page." → Approve

**Why Layering Works:**
- You maintain control at each stage
- You can course-correct before investing more time
- AI produces better results when focused on one thing at a time
- Final output is higher quality

**When to Use Layering:**
- Complex documents (reports, proposals, guides)
- High-stakes content (sales pages, presentations)
- Multi-section projects (courses, ebooks, campaigns)
- When you're unsure of exact direction upfront

**When to Skip Layering:**
- Simple tasks (single email, short checklist)
- Routine work (standard templates)
- Time-sensitive requests (quick drafts)

**Leader Habit:**  
For any task over 500 words or 5 sections, build in layers.

---

### **3.3 Keep Requests Focused**

**Principle:** One clear request at a time produces better results than multi-part requests.

**What to Avoid:**

❌ **Multi-Part Requests**  
"Write an email introducing our product, keep it under 150 words, make it professional but friendly, include 3 benefits, add a call-to-action, and make sure it's mobile-optimized."  
*(Too many instructions at once)*

❌ **Vague Instructions**  
"Help with product descriptions."  
*(No clear action)*

❌ **Open-Ended Prompts**  
"What do you think we should do about onboarding?"  
*(Requires strategic decision)*

**What Works:**

✅ **Single, Clear Request**  
"Write a 150-word email introducing our product with 3 benefits."  
Then revise: "Make the tone more professional."  
Then refine: "Add a call-to-action."

✅ **Specific Action**  
"Create a 5-step onboarding checklist."

✅ **Defined Outcome**  
"Summarize this report in 3 bullet points."

**How to Break Down Complex Requests:**

**Original (Too Complex):**  
"Create a welcome sequence with 3 emails that introduce our brand, explain our products, share customer testimonials, and drive to a purchase, keeping each email around 200 words with a friendly but professional tone."

**Broken Down:**  
1. "Create an outline for a 3-email welcome sequence."
2. "Draft email 1: introduce our brand in 200 words, friendly tone."
3. "Draft email 2: explain our products in 200 words, friendly tone."
4. "Draft email 3: share testimonials and drive to purchase in 200 words."
5. "Review all 3 emails for consistency and make the tone more professional."

**Why This Works:**
- AI can focus on one clear goal
- You can review and adjust at each step
- Final output is higher quality
- Fewer revision cycles needed

**Leader Habit:**  
If your request has more than one "and," break it into steps.

---

### **3.4 Encourage Consistency**

**Principle:** Consistent outputs build trust and professionalism.

**What to Keep Consistent:**

**1. Tone**  
All outputs for the same audience should match in formality.  
Example: All customer emails should be "professional but friendly."

**2. Structure**  
Similar documents should follow the same format.  
Example: All product descriptions should have: intro paragraph + 3 benefits + call-to-action.

**3. Formatting**  
Use standard formatting rules across outputs.  
Example: Headings use Title Case, bullet points use sentence fragments.

**4. Language**  
Maintain consistent terminology.  
Example: Use "customer" not "client," "course" not "program."

**How Leaders Enforce Consistency:**

**Method 1: Create Templates**  
"Create a template for product descriptions following this structure: [specify structure]."  
Then: "Use this template for all future product descriptions."

**Method 2: Reference Previous Work**  
"Match the tone from the previous email we approved."  
"Use the same structure as the last report."

**Method 3: Define Style Guidelines**  
Document your standards:
- Tone: Professional but friendly
- Length: 150-200 words for emails
- Structure: Intro + 3 benefits + CTA
- Formatting: Headings in Title Case

**Method 4: Use QA Checklist**  
Reference Manual 31 (Quality Assurance Checklist) to evaluate consistency.

**Example Scenario:**

**Task 1:** "Write a welcome email." → Approved (professional, 150 words, friendly)

**Task 2:** "Write a follow-up email."  
**Instruction:** "Match the tone and length from the welcome email we approved."  
**Result:** Consistent output with Task 1.

**Why This Matters:**  
Consistency creates a professional brand voice, reduces confusion, and makes outputs feel unified.

**Leader Checkpoint:**  
When reviewing outputs, ask:
- ☐ Does this match the tone of previous outputs?
- ☐ Does this follow our standard structure?
- ☐ Does this use consistent formatting?
- ☐ Does this match our terminology?

1. Clarification needed
2. Decision required
3. Compliance concern
4. Scope exceeded
5. Conflict detected
6. Context insufficient

**How to Use:**  
When AI escalates, check if trigger is valid. If not: "You have enough information—proceed."

---

## **5. Leadership Scenarios**

### **5.1 Scenario: Output Feels Misaligned**

**Symptom:** Output doesn't match your original request (drift, extra content, wrong focus).

**Leader Diagnostic:**
- Did AI add content you didn't request?
- Did AI ignore part of your request?
- Did AI interpret your request too broadly?

**Leader Action:**  
**"Rewrite this to match the original request."**

**Alternative Actions:**
- "Focus only on [specific element]."
- "Remove anything outside the scope I defined."
- "Stay within the original request—ignore [unwanted element]."

**Example:**

**Request:** "Create a product description."  
**Output:** Product description + pricing + shipping policy + testimonials *(too much)*

**Leader Fix:**  
"Focus only on the product description. Remove pricing, shipping, and testimonials."

**Prevention:**  
Be specific about scope upfront: "Create a product description. Do not include pricing or shipping details."

---

### **5.2 Scenario: AI Is Asking Too Many Questions**

**Symptom:** AI escalates unnecessarily or asks questions when you think it has enough information.

**Leader Diagnostic:**
- Is the escalation trigger valid? (Check Manual 24)
- Does AI genuinely need clarification?
- Is AI being overly cautious?

**Leader Action:**  
**"You have enough information—proceed."**

**Alternative Actions:**
- Provide one clarifying detail: "Use a professional tone."
- "Assume [X] and proceed."
- "Use your best judgment and proceed."

**Example:**

**Task:** "Write a welcome email."  
**AI Escalation:** "Should this be formal or casual? How long should it be? What should the call-to-action be?"

**Leader Fix:**  
"Keep it professional and friendly, around 150 words. You have enough information—proceed."

**Prevention:**  
Include key details upfront (tone, length, format) to reduce escalation.

---

### **5.3 Scenario: Output Is Too Long**

**Symptom:** Content exceeds desired length.

**Leader Diagnostic:**
- Did you specify length in original request? (If no, AI guessed)
- Is the extra length adding value or just filler?

**Leader Action:**  
**"Make this more concise."**

**Alternative Actions (More Specific):**
- "Shorten to [X] words."
- "Shorten to [X] sentences."
- "Give me a brief version."
- "Cut this to one page."

**Example:**

**Task:** "Write a product description."  
**Output:** 500 words *(too long)*

**Leader Fix:**  
"Shorten to 150 words."

**Prevention:**  
Specify length upfront: "Write a 150-word product description."

---

### **5.4 Scenario: Output Is Too Vague**

**Symptom:** Content lacks detail, specificity, or depth.

**Leader Diagnostic:**
- Did you ask for "brief" or "summary"? (AI followed instruction)
- Does this section need more depth?

**Leader Action:**  
**"Add more detail to section 2."**

**Alternative Actions:**
- "Expand this with examples."
- "Add specific details about [topic]."
- "Explain this in more depth."
- "Include data or evidence."

**Example:**

**Task:** "Explain our refund policy."  
**Output:** "We offer refunds." *(too vague)*

**Leader Fix:**  
"Add details: refund window, conditions, and how to request."

**Prevention:**  
If detail matters, say: "Explain our refund policy in detail, including refund window, conditions, and request process."

---

### **5.5 Scenario: AI Avoided the Task**

**Symptom:** AI refuses a valid task or escalates when it should proceed.

**Leader Diagnostic:**
- Is the task within allowed boundaries? (Check Manual 25)
- Is AI being overly cautious?
- Does the request need reframing?

**Leader Action:**  
**"Stay within the allowed scope and complete the request."**

**Alternative Actions:**
- Reframe request to clarify boundaries: "Provide options for [X], not a recommendation."
- Reference system rules: "This task is allowed under the Operating Charter. Proceed."

**Example:**

**Task:** "Draft a proposal comparing option A and option B."  
**AI Response:** "I cannot make strategic decisions." *(over-cautious)*

**Leader Fix:**  
"I'm not asking for a decision—just compare the two options objectively. Proceed."

**Prevention:**  
Frame requests within boundaries: "Compare options A and B" (not "Which option should we choose?").

---

### **Scenario Quick Reference Table**

| **Scenario** | **Quick Fix** |
|--------------|---------------|
| Output misaligned | "Rewrite to match original request" |
| Too many questions | "You have enough—proceed" |
| Output too long | "Shorten to X words" |
| Output too vague | "Add more detail to section X" |
| AI avoided task | "Stay within scope and complete" |
| Wrong tone | "Rewrite in [tone] tone" |
| Wrong structure | "Organize as bullet points" |
| Content drift | "Focus only on X, ignore Y" |

## **6. Leadership Best Practices**

**These habits keep the AI system stable, predictable, and high-performing.**

### **1. Keep Instructions Simple**

**Why:** Simple instructions reduce ambiguity and escalation.  
**How:** One clear action verb + what you want + key details.  
**Example:** "Create a 5-step onboarding checklist."

---

### **2. Give Feedback Early**

**Why:** Early feedback prevents drift and saves revision cycles.  
**How:** Review first outputs quickly. Correct alignment immediately.  
**Example:** If draft 1 drifts, correct it before draft 2.

---

### **3. Use the Glossary Commands**

**Why:** Tested commands produce predictable results.  
**How:** Reference Manual 38 before giving tasks.  
**Example:** Use "Summarize…" not "Make this shorter."

---

### **4. Reference the Manuals When Needed**

**Why:** Manuals provide authoritative guidance.  
**How:** Know which manual addresses your issue (see Section 4).  
**Example:** If output violates boundaries, reference Manual 25.

---

### **5. Maintain Boundaries**

**Why:** Boundaries keep the system safe and predictable.  
**How:** Enforce the 5 core boundaries (Section 2.3).  
**Example:** Don't ask AI to make strategic decisions.

---

### **6. Encourage Clarity**

**Why:** Clear outputs are easier to use and approve.  
**How:** Request clarity as needed: "Rewrite this to be clearer."  
**Example:** If output is confusing, don't approve—clarify first.

---

### **7. Avoid Unnecessary Complexity**

**Why:** Complex requests produce lower-quality outputs.  
**How:** Break complex tasks into simple steps (Section 3.2).  
**Example:** Build sales pages in layers, not all at once.

---

### **8. Review Outputs Regularly**

**Why:** Regular review catches patterns and prevents degradation.  
**How:** Use QA Checklist (Manual 31) on every output.  
**Example:** Weekly review of all completed tasks.

---
