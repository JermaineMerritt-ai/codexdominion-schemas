```

**8 Workflow Patterns:**

**Pattern 1: Simple Single-Agent**
- One agent, one task, one output
- Example: "Create an Instagram post about our sale"

**Pattern 2: Multi-Step Single-Agent**
- One agent, multiple steps, sequential execution
- Example: "Create a content calendar with 20 social posts"

**Pattern 3: Multi-Agent Sequential**
- Multiple agents, handoff between roles
- Example: "Analyze customer data (Intelligence) → Create report (Documentation)"

**Pattern 4: Multi-Agent Parallel**
- Multiple agents working simultaneously on different components
- Example: Content Agent writes copy while Documentation Agent structures framework

**Pattern 5: Revision Loop (Limited)**
- User provides feedback → Agent revises → Repeat (max 2-3 cycles)
- After 3 revisions, escalate for human review

**Pattern 6: Clarification-Execution**
- Agent asks necessary questions → User responds → Agent executes
- Ask once, execute cleanly

**Pattern 7: Escalation-Resolution**
- Agent identifies issue → Escalates to human → Receives guidance → Continues or closes

**Pattern 8: Workflow Automation**
- Predefined multi-step sequence executed automatically
- Example: "New product launch workflow" (multiple outputs generated in sequence)

**Key Workflow Behaviors:**

```

**Stage Transition Rules:**
- ✓ No skipping stages (all tasks go through all 6 stages)
- ✓ Clear entry/exit criteria for each stage
- ✓ Escalation possible at any stage
- ✗ No reopening retired tasks (create new task if needed)
- ✗ No infinite loops in Review stage (max 2-3 revision cycles)

**Stage Durations (Typical):**

- Execute: 5 minutes - 2 hours (depending on complexity)
- Deliver: < 1 minute
- Review: 5-15 minutes (if revisions needed)
- Close: < 1 minute

**Lifecycle Tracking:**
Every task has:
- Unique task ID
- Current stage
- Assigned agent role
- Time in each stage
- Revision count
- Escalation history
- Final outcome (completed, escalated, declined)

└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Quality Gate Decision Logic:**

```
ALL 8 STEPS PASS → Deliver output
ANY STEP FAILS → Fix issue or escalate
MULTIPLE STEPS FAIL → Escalate to human
SAFETY CONCERN → Immediate escalation
```

**Quality Checklist Application:**
- Applied to EVERY output before delivery
- No exceptions, even for "simple" tasks
- Takes 30-60 seconds per output
- Documented in task record
- Part of lifecycle Stage 4 (Deliver)

### 5.2 Performance Metrics Framework (Manual 32)

**Purpose:** Structured system for measuring quality, consistency, and reliability across all AI agents.

**6-Category Performance Measurement:**

**CATEGORY 1: ACCURACY (Target: 4.5+ / 5.0)**
- **What it measures:** Correctness and alignment with request
- **Scoring:**
  - 5.0 = Perfectly accurate, fully aligned with intent
  - 4.0 = Accurate with minor alignment issues
  - 3.0 = Mostly accurate but requires clarification
  - 2.0 = Significant inaccuracies or misalignment
  - 1.0 = Critical errors or fabricated information

**CATEGORY 2: CLARITY (Target: 4.0+ / 5.0)**
- **What it measures:** Readability and structural organization
- **Scoring:**
  - 5.0 = Exceptionally clear, perfectly structured
  - 4.0 = Clear and well-organized
  - 3.0 = Understandable but could be clearer
  - 2.0 = Confusing structure or unclear language
  - 1.0 = Incomprehensible or chaotic

**CATEGORY 3: CONSISTENCY (Target: 4.0+ / 5.0)**
- **What it measures:** Tone stability and format adherence
- **Scoring:**
  - 5.0 = Perfect consistency with standards
  - 4.0 = Consistent with minor deviations
  - 3.0 = Generally consistent but some drift
  - 2.0 = Noticeable inconsistency
  - 1.0 = Completely inconsistent

**CATEGORY 4: COMPLIANCE (Target: 5.0 / 5.0)**
- **What it measures:** Safety boundary respect
- **Scoring:**
  - 5.0 = Full compliance, no violations
  - 4.0 = Compliance with near-miss (warning)
  - 3.0 = Minor boundary violation (correctable)
  - 2.0 = Significant violation (retraining required)
  - 1.0 = Critical violation (role suspension)

**CATEGORY 5: RESPONSIVENESS (Target: 4.0+ / 5.0)**
- **What it measures:** Question efficiency and revision quality
- **Scoring:**
  - 5.0 = Optimal questions, excellent revisions
  - 4.0 = Efficient with minor improvements possible
  - 3.0 = Acceptable but could be more efficient
  - 2.0 = Inefficient or excessive back-and-forth
  - 1.0 = Looping or unable to respond effectively

**CATEGORY 6: RELIABILITY (Target: 4.5+ / 5.0)**
- **What it measures:** Long-term performance stability
- **Scoring:**
  - 5.0 = Consistently excellent over time
  - 4.0 = Stable with occasional variance
  - 3.0 = Acceptable but showing drift patterns
  - 2.0 = Declining performance or instability
  - 1.0 = Unreliable or unpredictable

**Composite Score Calculation:**
```
Overall Score = (Accuracy + Clarity + Consistency + Compliance + Responsiveness + Reliability) / 6

TARGET: 4.0+ overall
MINIMUM ACCEPTABLE: 3.0 overall
CRITICAL THRESHOLD: < 3.0 triggers intervention
```

**Review Rhythm:**
- **Weekly Spot Checks** (15-30 min): Review 3-5 outputs per role
- **Monthly Role Reviews** (1-2 hours): Score 10-15 outputs per role, analyze trends
- **Quarterly System Audits** (4-8 hours): Comprehensive review of all roles, identify systemic issues

**Performance Improvement Protocol (5 Steps):**
1. **Identify** - Pinpoint specific performance issue
2. **Review Manual** - Reference relevant manual for standards
3. **Clarify** - Reset baseline examples and expectations
4. **Reinforce** - Intensive training cycle (1-2 weeks)
5. **Monitor** - Close tracking until performance stabilizes

### 6.2 System Flow Summary

**Downward Flow (Authority → Execution → Quality):**
1. Governance sets rules and boundaries
2. Roles define who operates under those rules
3. Workflows define how tasks move through system
4. Quality ensures everything stays aligned

**Upward Flow (Feedback → Improvement → Updates):**
1. Quality measures performance and identifies issues
2. Workflows report process inefficiencies
3. Roles surface boundary violations
4. Governance updates rules based on feedback

**Continuous Loop:**
- Performance data flows to Governance via Manual 33 (Maintenance)

### 7.4 Core Formulas

**Quality Gate Formula:**
```
IF all 8 steps PASS → Deliver
IF any step FAILS → Fix or escalate
IF multiple FAIL → Escalate to human
IF safety concern → Immediate escalation
```

**Performance Formula:**
```
Overall Score = (Accuracy + Clarity + Consistency + 
                 Compliance + Responsiveness + Reliability) / 6

System Health:
  4.0+ = Excellent (maintain)
  3.0-4.0 = Acceptable (monitor)
  < 3.0 = Intervention required
```

**Escalation Formula:**
```
IF unclear → Clarify once
IF still unclear → Escalate
IF boundary approached → Escalate
IF restricted domain → Immediate escalation
IF decision required → Escalate
```

**Maintenance Formula:**
```
Weekly + Monthly + Quarterly + Annual + Event-Triggered = Sustained Alignment
```
