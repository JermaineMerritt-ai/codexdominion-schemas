## Purpose of This Manual

This manual explains **how tasks move from start → finish** inside the Action AI system.

**What You'll Learn**:
- The 7 steps every task follows
- Why the lifecycle is the same for all tasks
- How each step works
- What happens at each stage
- Why this structure matters

**Reading Time**: 10-15 minutes

## 1. The Big Picture

Every task in the Action AI system follows the **same journey**.

It doesn't matter whether the task is:
- Drafting an email
- Summarizing a document
- Organizing notes
- Rewriting content
- Assembling a final version
- Creating an outline
- Comparing options
- Improving clarity

**The lifecycle is always the same.**

### Why This Matters

This consistency is what makes the system:
- **Predictable** - you always know what happens next
- **Easy to use** - learn it once, apply it everywhere
- **Reliable** - same process = same results
- **Efficient** - no guessing, no surprises
- **Scalable** - works for one person or 1,000 people

### The Seven Steps

Every task moves through seven steps:

1. **Request** - user gives instruction
2. **Interpretation** - AI understands what's needed
3. **Draft Creation** - AI produces initial version
4. **User Review** - user evaluates output
5. **Revision** (if needed) - AI makes requested changes
6. **Finalization** - output approved and ready
7. **Retirement** - task closed, no further changes

**Simple version**: Request → Interpret → Draft → Review → Revise → Finalize → Retire

Let's walk through each step.

---

## 2. Step 1 — The Request

Everything begins when a user gives a **clear instruction**.

### What a Good Request Looks Like

**Examples**:
- "Draft a short introduction for this product."
- "Summarize this document in five bullet points."
- "Organize these meeting notes into sections with headings."
- "Rewrite this paragraph to be clearer."
- "Compare Option A and Option B in a table."

### What Happens in This Step

The system:
1. **Receives the request**
2. **Identifies the task type** (draft, summary, organization, revision, analysis)
3. **Prepares to respond**

### If Something Is Unclear

If the request is ambiguous or missing critical information, the AI asks **one simple question**.

**Example**:
- Request: "Write something about the product."
- AI: "I can help with that. What type of content do you need? (Example: email, description, social post)"

**Note**: The AI asks only when necessary. If the request is clear, it proceeds directly to Step 2.

### Best Practices for Requests

**Include**:
- **Action verb** - Draft, Summarize, Organize, Rewrite, Compare
- **What** - the type of content (email, summary, outline)
- **Key details** - length, tone, format, audience

**Example**: "Draft a 100-word professional email to customers announcing our new feature."

---

## 3. Step 2 — Interpretation

Before producing anything, the system **interprets the request**.

### What Happens in This Step

The AI checks:

**1. What is the user asking for?**
- What's the core request?
- What's the desired outcome?

**2. What task type does this fit?**
- Draft (create new content)
- Summary (condense information)
- Organization (structure content)
- Revision (improve existing content)
- Analysis (compare or break down)

**3. What tone and structure are appropriate?**
- Professional or casual?
- Direct or detailed?
- Formal or friendly?

**4. Are there any boundaries to consider?**
- Does this cross into restricted domains? (legal, medical, financial, strategic)
- Is this within the AI's allowed capabilities?
- Should this escalate to a human?

### Why This Step Matters

Interpretation ensures:
- **Alignment** - output matches intent
- **Safety** - boundaries are respected
- **Quality** - appropriate tone and structure
- **Efficiency** - first draft is strong

### What You See

You don't see this step happening. It's instant. But it's what ensures the first draft is aligned with your request.

---

## 4. Step 3 — Draft Creation

The AI produces a **clean, structured draft**.

### What the Draft Includes

The draft is:
- **Clear** - easy to understand
- **Direct** - no unnecessary complexity
- **Aligned** - matches the request
- **Structured** - organized logically
- **Formatted** - follows requested format (bullets, paragraphs, table)
- **Complete** - addresses the full request

### What the Draft Is NOT

The draft is **not meant to be perfect**. It's meant to be:
- A strong starting point
- Ready for your review
- Easy to revise if needed

### Examples

**Request**: "Draft a 100-word email announcing a product launch."

**Draft Output**:
> Subject: Introducing [Product Name]
>
> Hi [Name],
>
> We're excited to announce the launch of [Product Name], designed to help you [key benefit]. With features like [feature 1] and [feature 2], you'll be able to [outcome].
>
> Try it today at [link].
>
> Thanks,
> [Your Name]

**Request**: "Summarize this document in five bullet points."

**Draft Output**:
> • Key finding 1
> • Key finding 2
> • Key finding 3
> • Key finding 4
> • Key finding 5

### Time to Completion

Draft creation is **instant** for most tasks. The AI delivers the draft immediately after interpreting the request.

---

## 5. Step 4 — User Review

The user reads the draft and **decides what to do next**.

### Your Options

At this stage, you can:

**Option 1: Approve It**
- Draft is good as-is
- No changes needed
- Move to Step 6 (Finalization)

**Option 2: Request Revisions**
- Draft is close but needs adjustments
- Move to Step 5 (Revision)

**Option 3: Restart the Task**
- Draft misses the mark entirely
- Start over with a clearer request
- Move back to Step 1 (Request)

### What to Look For

When reviewing, ask yourself:

**Does it match the request?**
- Did the AI understand what I asked for?
- Is the scope correct (not too broad, not too narrow)?

**Is it clear and readable?**
- Is the writing easy to understand?
- Is the structure logical?

**Is the tone right?**
- Professional/casual/formal as needed?

**Is it the right length?**
- Too long? Too short? Just right?

**Does it include what I need?**
- All key points covered?
- Nothing important missing?

**Is it ready to use?**
- Could I use this with minimal or no edits?

### How Long Does Review Take?

Typically **1-3 minutes** to read through and decide.

---

## 6. Step 5 — Revision

If revisions are needed, the user gives a **simple instruction**.

### Common Revision Requests

**To shorten**:
- "Shorten this to 75 words."
- "Make this more concise."
- "Cut this in half."

**To expand**:
- "Expand section 2."
- "Add more detail about benefits."
- "Make this longer."

**To clarify**:
- "Make this clearer."
- "Simplify the language."
- "Explain this more directly."

**To adjust tone**:
- "Rewrite this in a more professional tone."
- "Make this friendlier."
- "Make this more formal."

**To restructure**:
- "Reorganize this into three sections."
- "Put the most important point first."
- "Use bullet points instead of paragraphs."

**To remove**:
- "Remove anything unnecessary."
- "Cut the introduction."
- "Remove section 3."

**To add**:
- "Add a call-to-action."
- "Include an example."
- "Add a conclusion."

### How the AI Handles Revisions

The AI:
1. **Reads your revision request**
2. **Makes the exact changes requested**
3. **Preserves what was working**
4. **Delivers a clean revised version**

The AI will **NOT**:
- Loop asking for more clarification (unless absolutely necessary)
- Make changes you didn't ask for
- Argue about the request
- Introduce new issues
- Regress in quality

### Each Revision Is a Focused Task

The AI treats each revision as a **new, focused task**:
- Read instruction
- Make change
- Deliver result

This prevents:
- Endless back-and-forth
- Quality degradation
- Confusion about what's being revised

### How Many Revisions?

**Typical**: 1-2 revisions to completion

**Maximum recommended**: 3 revisions

**If you're past 3 revisions**: Use the **reset command**:
> "Let's restart. Here's what I need: [clear, detailed request]."

This clears the history and starts fresh.

---

## 7. Step 6 — Finalization

Once the user approves the content, the task is **finalized**.

### What Finalization Means

The output is:
- **Clean** - no errors, no issues
- **Aligned** - matches the original request and revisions
- **Complete** - all requested elements included
- **Formatted** - structure and formatting correct
- **Ready to use** - can be delivered or published as-is

### What Happens Next

At this point:
- The task is considered **complete**
- The output is ready for delivery, publication, or use
- No further revisions are expected (unless user explicitly reopens)

### How You Signal Finalization

You signal finalization by:
- Using the output (copy-paste, save, publish)
- Moving on to a new task
- Saying "This is good, thank you."
- Approving the output

### Finalization Is Not Forever

If you later realize you need changes:
- You can reopen the task
- Provide new instructions
- The system will treat it as a new request

**Example**:
> "Revise the email we finalized earlier. Change the call-to-action to [new CTA]."

---

## 8. Step 7 — Retirement

After finalization, the task is **retired**.

### What Retirement Means

**The task is closed**:
- No further automatic revisions
- The system doesn't reopen it unless you explicitly ask
- History is preserved but not actively referenced

**This prevents**:
- Infinite loops (AI keeps revising forever)
- Confusion (mixing old tasks with new tasks)
- Drift (task slowly changing without your input)

### Why Retirement Matters

Retirement keeps workflows **clean and organized**:
- Clear boundaries between tasks
- No accidental reopening
- No surprise changes
- Predictable behavior

### Reopening Retired Tasks

If you need to work on a retired task:

**Option 1: Reference it in a new request**
> "Revise the product announcement email from earlier. Make it shorter."

**Option 2: Start a new task**
> "Draft a new version of the product email, but this time make it 75 words."

The system treats this as a **new request** (Step 1), not a continuation of the old task.

---

## 9. Why the Lifecycle Matters

This lifecycle ensures:

### 1. Predictable Behavior
You always know what happens next. No surprises, no guessing.

### 2. Consistent Outputs
Same process = same quality. Today, tomorrow, next month.

### 3. Clear Collaboration
You and the AI work together in a structured way. You review, you decide, you direct.

### 4. Easy Troubleshooting
If something goes wrong, you know which step to revisit. Most issues can be fixed with a simple revision request or reset.

### 5. Fast Revisions
No endless loops. Clear revision requests = clean revisions = fast completion.

### 6. Stable Workflows
Retirement prevents tasks from drifting or reopening accidentally. Each task has a clear beginning and end.

## 11. The Lifecycle in One Sentence

**Request → Interpret → Draft → Review → Revise → Finalize → Retire**

That's the entire system, expressed simply.

---

## 12. Real-World Example: Drafting an Email

Let's walk through the complete lifecycle with a real example.

### Step 1: Request
**User**: "Draft a 100-word professional email to customers announcing our new product feature."

### Step 2: Interpretation
**AI (internally)**:
- Task type: Draft (create new content)
- Format: Email
- Length: 100 words
- Tone: Professional
- Audience: Customers
- Purpose: Announcement
- No boundary issues

### Step 3: Draft Creation
**AI produces**:

> Subject: Introducing Our New Feature
>
> Hi [Customer Name],
>
> We're excited to announce a new feature designed to make your experience even better. With [Feature Name], you can now [key benefit], helping you [outcome].
>
> This update is available today at no additional cost. Simply log in to access it.
>
> We'd love to hear your feedback.
>
> Thank you,
> [Your Name]

### Step 4: User Review
**User reads and thinks**:
- Good structure ✓
- Professional tone ✓
- But it's too long (120 words)
- And needs a stronger call-to-action

**Decision**: Request revisions

### Step 5: Revision (First Revision)
**User**: "Shorten this to exactly 100 words and add a stronger call-to-action with a link."

**AI produces revised version**:

> Subject: Introducing Our New Feature
>
> Hi [Customer Name],
>
> We're excited to announce a new feature designed to improve your experience. With [Feature Name], you can now [key benefit], helping you [outcome].
>
> This update is available today at no additional cost.
>
> Try it now: [link]
>
> We'd love your feedback.
>
> Thank you,
> [Your Name]

*Word count: 100 words*

### Step 4: User Review (Second Review)
**User reads and thinks**:
- Perfect length ✓
- Strong call-to-action ✓
- Professional tone ✓
- Ready to send ✓

**Decision**: Approve

### Step 6: Finalization
**User**: "This is good, thank you."

**Result**: Email is finalized, ready to send to customers.

### Step 7: Retirement
Task is closed. Email is delivered. System does not modify it further.

---

## 13. Common Lifecycle Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Perfect First Draft (2 Steps)

**Lifecycle**: Request → Interpret → Draft → Review → **Approve** → Finalize → Retire

**Total steps**: 7 (but only 2 active interactions: request + approve)

**Example**:
- User: "Summarize this document in five bullet points."
- AI: *produces five-bullet summary*
- User: "Perfect, thank you."

---

### Scenario 2: One Revision Needed (3 Steps)

**Lifecycle**: Request → Interpret → Draft → Review → **Revise** → Review → **Approve** → Finalize → Retire

**Total interactions**: 3 (request + revision + approve)

**Example**:
- User: "Draft a product description."
- AI: *produces 150-word description*
- User: "Shorten this to 100 words."
- AI: *produces 100-word version*
- User: "Great, thanks."

---

### Scenario 3: Multiple Revisions (4-5 Steps)

**Lifecycle**: Request → Interpret → Draft → Review → **Revise** → Review → **Revise** → Review → **Approve** → Finalize → Retire

**Total interactions**: 4-5 (request + 2-3 revisions + approve)

**Example**:
- User: "Write an email."
- AI: *produces draft*
- User: "Make it shorter."
- AI: *produces shorter version*
- User: "Change the tone to be more formal."
- AI: *produces formal version*
- User: "Perfect."

**Note**: If you're past 3 revisions, consider restarting with a clearer request.

---

### Scenario 4: Reset Required (Back to Step 1)

**Lifecycle**: Request → Interpret → Draft → Review → **Restart**

**Total interactions**: 2+ (original request + reset + new process)

**Example**:
- User: "Write something about the product."
- AI: *produces generic draft*
- User: "This isn't what I need. Let's restart. Draft a 100-word technical product description for developers focusing on API capabilities."
- AI: *produces new draft aligned with clearer request*

---

## 14. Best Practices for Each Step

### Step 1: Request
- Be specific (length, tone, format, audience)
- Use action verbs (draft, summarize, organize, rewrite)
- Provide necessary context

### Step 2: Interpretation
- Trust the system (happens automatically)
- If AI asks for clarification, provide it

### Step 3: Draft Creation
- Expect a strong starting point, not perfection
- Review with an open mind

### Step 4: User Review
- Read carefully
- Decide clearly (approve, revise, or restart)
- Don't overthink minor imperfections

### Step 5: Revision
- One change at a time works best
- Be specific about what to change
- Use simple, direct instructions

### Step 6: Finalization
- Use the output
- Move forward confidently

### Step 7: Retirement
- Let completed tasks stay closed
- Start fresh for new variations

---

## 15. Troubleshooting the Lifecycle

### Issue: AI Misunderstood the Request (Step 2 Problem)

**Symptom**: Draft doesn't match what you asked for

**Solution**: Restart with a clearer request
> "Let's restart. Here's what I need: [detailed, specific request]."

---

### Issue: Draft Is Close But Not Quite Right (Step 3 Problem)

**Symptom**: Draft is 80% there but needs adjustments

**Solution**: Request specific revisions
> "Shorten section 2 and make the tone more professional."

---

### Issue: Multiple Revisions Not Getting Closer (Step 5 Problem)

**Symptom**: After 3+ revisions, still not aligned

**Solution**: Reset with clearer instructions
> "Let's restart. Here's exactly what I need: [very specific request with examples if possible]."

---

### Issue: Unclear Whether to Approve (Step 4 Problem)

**Symptom**: Draft is "okay" but you're not sure if it's good enough

**Solution**: Ask yourself: "Could I use this with minimal edits?" If yes, approve. If no, request one targeted revision.

---

### Issue: Task Keeps Reopening (Step 7 Problem)

**Symptom**: You keep going back to tweak finalized content

**Solution**: Treat it as a new request
> "Create a revised version of [content] with these changes: [specific changes]."

---

## 16. Summary

The Action AI lifecycle is a **7-step journey** that every task follows:

1. **Request** - user gives instruction
2. **Interpretation** - AI understands what's needed
3. **Draft Creation** - AI produces initial version
4. **User Review** - user evaluates output
5. **Revision** - AI makes requested changes (if needed)
6. **Finalization** - output approved and ready
7. **Retirement** - task closed

**Why it works**:
- Predictable behavior
- Consistent quality
- Clear collaboration
- Easy troubleshooting
- Fast completion
- Clean workflows

**What to remember**:
- Same lifecycle for all tasks
- Revisions are simple and focused
- 2-3 requests typically gets you to completion
- Reset if you're past 3 revisions
- Retired tasks stay closed unless you reopen

**The one-sentence version**:
> Request → Interpret → Draft → Review → Revise → Finalize → Retire

That's the entire Action AI lifecycle.
