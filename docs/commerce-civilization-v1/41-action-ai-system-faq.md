Example: "Assemble this into a final document."

**If your request fits one of these 5 categories, the system can handle it.**

**See:** Manual 23 (Task Library) for 50+ specific task definitions

---

### **1.3 What can't Action AI do?**

**Answer:**  
To keep the system safe and predictable, Action AI **cannot:**

**1. Make Strategic Decisions**  
Cannot choose between options, set strategy, or make business judgments.  
❌ "Should we expand to Europe or Asia?"  
✅ "Compare pros and cons of expanding to Europe vs. Asia."

**2. Provide Licensed Professional Advice**  
Cannot give legal, medical, or financial advice.  
❌ "Is this contract legally binding?"  
✅ "Summarize the key terms in this contract."

**3. Interpret Sensitive Content**  
Cannot make judgments about personal, cultural, or political content.  
❌ "Is this customer complaint justified?"  
✅ "Summarize what the customer said."

**4. Use Emotional/Symbolic Language (Unless Requested)**  
Defaults to clear, professional language.  
❌ Adds poetic language without permission  
✅ Uses plain, direct language by default

**5. Act Autonomously**  
Cannot execute actions without approval (send emails, publish content, make purchases).  
❌ "Send this email to customers."  
✅ "Draft this email for my review."

**See:** Manual 25 (Safety & Compliance Addendum) for 11 restricted domains

---

## **2. USING THE SYSTEM**

### **2.1 How do I give effective instructions?**

**Answer:**  
Follow 3 simple principles:

**Principle 1: Be Clear**  
Say exactly what you want, not what you don't want.  
✅ "Create a 5-step checklist for launching a digital product."  
❌ "Help me with product stuff."

**Principle 2: Be Direct**  
Ask for output, not help.  
✅ "Write a welcome email."  
❌ "Can you help me with something?"

**Principle 3: Be Specific**  
Add details that matter (format, length, tone, audience).  
✅ "Write a 150-word professional email introducing our course."  
❌ "Write an email."

**Formula:**  
**Action Verb** + **What You Want** + **Key Details**

**Examples:**
- "Draft a product description for yoga mats aimed at beginners."
- "Summarize this report in 3 bullet points."
- "Organize these ideas into a content calendar."

**See:** Manual 36 (Onboarding Guide), Section 2 for detailed instruction guidance

---

### **2.2 Do I need to choose which AI role to use?**

**Answer:**  
**No.** The system routes tasks automatically to the right role.

**The 5 Specialized Roles:**
1. **Creator Support** → Product creation, digital assets
2. **Commerce Operations** → E-commerce, sales, revenue
3. **Content & Marketing** → Social media, emails, campaigns
4. **Documentation & Structuring** → Checklists, frameworks, organization
5. **Intelligence & Insights** → Analysis, summaries, comparisons

**How It Works:**  
When you give a request, the system analyzes it and routes to the best-fit role. You don't see this happening—it's automatic.

**Example:**  
Request: "Create a checklist for onboarding."  
→ System routes to **Documentation & Structuring**  
→ You get output without choosing anything

**Why This Matters:**  
You focus on what you need. The system handles the routing.

**See:** Manual 26 (Role Definitions & Domains) for complete role descriptions

---

### **2.3 What if I'm not sure how to phrase my request?**

**Answer:**  
**Start with an action verb.** These verbs produce predictable results:

**Top 10 Action Verbs:**
1. **Draft** → First version (needs refinement)
2. **Write** → Polished version (ready to use)
3. **Summarize** → Condense to essentials
4. **Organize** → Restructure format
5. **Compare** → Side-by-side analysis
6. **Rewrite** → Improve existing content
7. **List** → Numbered/bulleted sequence
8. **Create** → Make something new
9. **Expand** → Add detail
10. **Shorten** → Reduce length

**How to Use:**  
Pick the verb that matches your intent, then add what you want.

**Examples:**
- **Draft** a blog post about remote work
- **Summarize** this meeting transcript in 5 bullets
- **Organize** these customer requests by priority
- **Rewrite** this email to be more professional
- **Compare** pricing plan A and pricing plan B
- **List** the steps for setting up email automation

**Still Stuck?**  
Reference Manual 38 (User Command Glossary) for 70+ command examples.

**See:** Manual 38 (User Command Glossary) for complete command reference

---

## **3. OUTPUT QUALITY**

### **3.1 What if the output feels off?**

**Answer:**  
Use simple revision commands to fix specific issues.

**Quick Fixes:**

**If focus is wrong:**  
"Rewrite this to match the original request."  
"Focus only on [specific element]."

**If length is wrong:**  
"Make this more concise."  
"Shorten to 100 words."  
"Expand section 2."

**If tone is wrong:**  
"Rewrite in a professional tone."  
"Make this friendlier."  
"Simplify the language."

**If structure is wrong:**  
"Organize this into bullet points."  
"Format with headings."  
"Turn this into a checklist."

**If content has drift:**  
"Remove anything unnecessary."  
"Stay within the original request."  
"Ignore [unwanted element]."

**General Approach:**  
1. Identify what's wrong (focus, length, tone, structure, content)
2. Use a specific command to fix it
3. Limit to 2-3 revision cycles
4. Reset if not improving after 3 tries

**See:** Manual 37 (Troubleshooting Guide) for detailed fix instructions

---

### **3.2 Why does the AI sometimes ask questions?**

**Answer:**  
The AI only asks when your request is ambiguous or missing essential details.

**Common Escalation Triggers:**

**1. Clarification Needed**  
Request is vague or has multiple interpretations.  
Example: "Write an email" → AI asks: "What should this email be about?"

**2. Context Insufficient**  
AI needs format, audience, or length to proceed.  
Example: "Summarize this" → AI asks: "How many points? Brief or detailed?"

**3. Decision Required**  
Request involves a choice only humans can make.  
Example: "Which option is better?" → AI asks: "What criteria should I use?"

**What to Do:**

**If escalation feels valid:**  
Provide the requested detail: "Use a professional tone, 150 words."

**If escalation feels unnecessary:**  
Override with: "You have enough information—proceed."

**Prevention:**  
Include key details upfront (tone, length, format, audience) to reduce escalation.

**See:** Manual 24 (Escalation Matrix) for 6 escalation triggers

---

### **3.3 How do I fix tone issues?**

**Answer:**  
Use direct tone adjustment commands.

**Tone Adjustment Formula:**  
"Rewrite this in a **[tone]** tone."

**8 Tone Options:**

| **Tone** | **When to Use** | **Example** |
|----------|-----------------|-------------|
| **Professional** | Business communication | Client emails, reports |
| **Casual** | Friendly audiences | Team chats, casual updates |
| **Friendly** | Warm but not too casual | Customer service, welcome emails |
| **Formal** | High-stakes or traditional | Legal docs, executive reports |
| **Simple** | Beginners or non-experts | Tutorials, instructions |
| **Technical** | Expert audiences | Developer docs, technical specs |
| **Warm** | Empathetic, caring | Support messages, apologies |
| **Direct** | No-nonsense, efficient | Action items, urgent updates |

**Tone Spectrum:**  
Formal ↔ Professional ↔ Friendly ↔ Casual  
Complex ↔ Clear ↔ Simple

**Examples:**
- "Rewrite this in a professional tone."
- "Make this friendlier and more approachable."
- "Simplify this for beginners."
- "Make this more direct and action-oriented."

**Combination Commands:**  
"Rewrite in a professional but friendly tone."  
"Make this warm but keep it brief."

**See:** Manual 37 (Troubleshooting Guide), Section 3.3 for tone fixes

---

## **4. BOUNDARIES & SAFETY**

### **4.1 Why did the AI refuse my request?**

**Answer:**  
The request likely crossed one of the 5 core boundaries.

**The 5 Boundaries:**

**1. Strategic Decisions**  
AI cannot choose between options or make business judgments.  
Refused: "Should we hire candidate A or B?"  
Allowed: "Compare candidate A and B's qualifications."

**2. Licensed Professional Advice**  
AI cannot provide legal, medical, or financial advice.  
Refused: "Is this tax strategy legal?"  
Allowed: "Summarize the key points of this tax strategy."

**3. Sensitive Content Interpretation**  
AI cannot interpret personal, cultural, or political content.  
Refused: "Is this customer being unreasonable?"  
Allowed: "Summarize the customer's concerns."

**4. Emotional/Symbolic Language**  
AI defaults to clear, professional language unless you request otherwise.  
Refused: Adding poetic language without permission  
Allowed: Plain, direct language by default

**5. Autonomous Action**  
AI cannot execute actions without your approval.  
Refused: "Send this email now."  
Allowed: "Draft this email for my review."

**What to Do:**  
Reframe your request within boundaries. Change "make a decision" to "compare options." Change "give advice" to "provide information."

**See:** Manual 25 (Safety & Compliance Addendum) for 11 restricted domains

---

### **4.2 What should I do if the AI escalates?**

**Answer:**  
Provide the missing detail or restate the request clearly.

**Step-by-Step Response:**

**Step 1: Read the Escalation Message**  
AI will explain what's missing or unclear.  
Example: "This request requires a strategic decision. Please clarify: What criteria should I use to evaluate options?"

**Step 2: Decide If Escalation Is Valid**

**If valid:**  
Provide the missing information.  
Example: "Evaluate based on cost and ease of implementation."

**If unnecessary:**  
Override with: "You have enough information—proceed."

**Step 3: Proceed**  
AI will continue with your guidance.

**Common Escalation Scenarios:**

**Scenario 1: Ambiguity**  
AI: "Should this be formal or casual?"  
You: "Use a professional tone."

**Scenario 2: Missing Details**  
AI: "How long should this be?"  
You: "Keep it under 200 words."

**Scenario 3: Boundary Concern**  
AI: "This request requires a strategic decision."  
You: "Just compare the two options—don't recommend one."

**See:** Manual 24 (Escalation Matrix) for escalation response protocols

---

### **4.3 Can the AI make decisions for me?**

**Answer:**  
**No. Humans retain all strategic and judgment-based authority.**

**AI's Role:**  
Provide information, options, comparisons, and analysis. Never make the final decision.

**Human's Role:**  
Make decisions based on AI's analysis.

**How This Works in Practice:**

**Example 1: Strategic Choice**  
❌ AI cannot: "You should expand to Europe."  
✅ AI can: "Here's a comparison of Europe vs. Asia expansion with pros/cons for each."  
✅ Human decides: "We'll go with Europe."

**Example 2: Content Approval**  
❌ AI cannot: Publish content without review  
✅ AI can: Draft content for your approval  
✅ Human decides: "This draft looks good. Approved."

**Example 3: Prioritization**  
❌ AI cannot: "Focus on Task A, not Task B."  
✅ AI can: "Here are the pros/cons of prioritizing each task."  
✅ Human decides: "We'll prioritize Task A."

**Why This Matters:**  
Human judgment, context, and accountability remain essential. AI augments your decision-making—it doesn't replace it.

**See:** Manual 21 (Operating Charter) for authority structure

---

## **5. WORKFLOWS & TASKS**

### **5.1 How do tasks move through the system?**

**Answer:**  
Every task follows a 6-stage lifecycle.

**The 6-Stage Lifecycle:**

**Stage 1: Request**  
You give a clear instruction using an action verb + details.  
Example: "Create a 5-step onboarding checklist."

**Stage 2: Processing**  
AI interprets the task and routes to the appropriate role.  
(You don't see this—it's automatic)

**Stage 3: Output**  
AI delivers a clean, structured result.  
Example: Numbered checklist with 5 steps.

**Stage 4: Review**  
You evaluate whether the output meets your needs.  
Options: Approve, Revise, Reset

**Stage 5: Revision (If Needed)**  
You request specific changes.  
Example: "Shorten to 3 steps" or "Add time estimates."

**Stage 6: Completion**  
Task is marked complete and ready for use.

**Lifecycle Flowchart:**
```
Request → Processing → Output → Review
                                   ↓
                         ┌─────────┴─────────┐
                         ↓                   ↓
                      Approve            Revise
                         ↓                   ↓
                    Completion         Processing
                                           ↓
                                        Output
```

**Average Time:**  
Simple tasks: 1-2 minutes  
Complex tasks: 5-15 minutes (including revisions)

**See:** Manual 30 (Task Lifecycle Model) for complete lifecycle documentation

---

### **5.2 What if I want to restart a task?**

**Answer:**  
Use the restart command with clear new instructions.

**Restart Command:**  
"Let's restart. Here's what I need: [clear, specific request]."

**When to Restart:**
- Output is completely wrong (not just needing polish)
- You've done 3+ revisions and it's not improving
- You realize your original request was unclear
- The task has drifted too far from your intent

**How to Restart Effectively:**

**Step 1: Use the Restart Command**  
"Let's restart. Here's what I need…"

**Step 2: Give Clearer Instructions**  
Be more specific than your original request.  
- Add format details: "as bullet points," "with headings"
- Add length details: "in 100 words," "brief summary"
- Add tone details: "professional," "friendly"
- Add scope details: "focus only on X, ignore Y"

**Step 3: Proceed**  
AI will start fresh with your new instructions.

**Example:**

**Original Request:** "Create a product description."  
**Output:** Essay about product history *(wrong format)*  
**Revision 1:** "Make this a description, not an essay." → Still wrong  
**Revision 2:** "Focus on benefits." → Still drifting  
**Reset:** "Let's restart. Here's what I need: A 100-word product description with 3 benefits in bullet points."  
**New Output:** ✅ Correct format

**See:** Manual 37 (Troubleshooting Guide), Section 4 for reset guidance

---

### **5.3 How do I get a fresh draft?**

**Answer:**  
Use the fresh draft command with a specific focus.

**Fresh Draft Command:**  
"Create a fresh draft focusing on [specific element]."

**Fresh Draft vs. Reset:**

| **Fresh Draft** | **Reset** |
|-----------------|-----------|
| Keeps the topic | Wipes everything |
| Changes approach or focus | Starts completely over |
| Use when direction is wrong | Use when everything is wrong |
| Example: "Fresh draft focusing on benefits, not features" | Example: "Let's restart with new instructions" |

**When to Use Fresh Draft:**
- Tone is completely off
- Structure doesn't match what you need
- Content is cluttered or unfocused
- You want a different angle on the same topic

**How to Use Fresh Draft:**

**Step 1: Identify What to Keep**  
Same topic? Same audience? Same general goal?

**Step 2: Specify the New Focus**  
"Create a fresh draft focusing on [new angle]."

**Step 3: Add Constraints**  
"Keep it under 150 words, professional tone."

**Examples:**
- "Create a fresh draft focusing on customer benefits, not product features."
- "Create a fresh draft with a friendlier tone and simpler language."
- "Create a fresh draft structured as bullet points, not paragraphs."

**See:** Manual 37 (Troubleshooting Guide), Section 5 for fresh draft guidance

---

## **6. TROUBLESHOOTING**

### **6.1 The output is too long. What now?**

**Answer:**  
**"Make this more concise."**

**More Specific Options:**
- "Shorten to [X] words."
- "Shorten to [X] sentences."
- "Give me a brief version."
- "Cut this to one page."

**Length Quick Reference:**

| **Term** | **Target Length** |
|----------|-------------------|
| **Brief** | 50-100 words, 3-5 bullets |
| **Medium** | 150-300 words, 5-10 bullets |
| **Detailed** | 300-500 words, 10-15 bullets |
| **Comprehensive** | 500+ words, 15+ bullets |

**Example:**

**Problem:** 500-word email (too long for quick read)  
**Fix:** "Shorten to 150 words."  
**Result:** Concise email hitting key points

**Prevention:**  
Specify length upfront: "Write a 150-word email…"

**See:** Manual 37 (Troubleshooting Guide), Section 2.2 for length fixes

---

### **6.2 The output is too vague. What now?**

**Answer:**  
**"Add more detail to section [X]."**

**More Specific Options:**
- "Expand this with examples."
- "Add specific details about [topic]."
- "Explain this in more depth."
- "Include data or evidence."

**When Output Is Too Vague:**
- Statements lack supporting detail
- Instructions are unclear
- Explanations are surface-level
- Examples are missing

**How to Fix:**

**Identify Which Part Needs Detail:**  
"Section 2 is too vague."

**Specify What Kind of Detail:**  
- Examples: "Add 2-3 examples to section 2."
- Specifics: "Include specific pricing details."
- Depth: "Explain the benefits in more depth."
- Data: "Add statistics or evidence."

**Example:**

**Problem:** "We offer great customer service." *(too vague)*  
**Fix:** "Add specific details: response time, support channels, availability."  
**Result:** "We offer 24/7 customer support via email, chat, and phone with average response time under 2 hours."

**Prevention:**  
If detail matters, say: "Explain [topic] in detail, including [specific elements]."

**See:** Manual 37 (Troubleshooting Guide), Section 3.1 for clarity fixes

---

### **6.3 The AI misinterpreted my request. What now?**

**Answer:**  
**Restate the request in one clear sentence.**

**Quick Fix:**  
"Focus only on [what you actually want]. Ignore [what you don't want]."

**Why Misinterpretation Happens:**
- Request was vague
- Multiple interpretations were possible
- Key details were missing
- Scope wasn't defined

**How to Fix:**

**Option 1: Refocus**  
"Focus only on product benefits. Ignore pricing and features."

**Option 2: Clarify Scope**  
"I only need a description, not a full sales page."

**Option 3: Restart**  
"Let's restart. Here's what I need: [clear, specific request]."

**Example:**

**Original Request:** "Tell me about our product."  
**AI Output:** Product history, technical specs, pricing, shipping *(too much)*  
**Fix:** "Focus only on customer benefits. Remove history, specs, pricing, and shipping."  
**Result:** ✅ Benefit-focused description

**Prevention:**  
Use the instruction formula: **Action Verb + What You Want + Key Details**

**See:** Manual 37 (Troubleshooting Guide), Section 2.1 for alignment fixes

---

### **6.4 The AI is looping or stuck. What now?**

**Answer:**  
**Reset the task: "Let's restart. Here's what I need…"**

**Signs of Looping:**
- Same issues after 3+ revisions
- AI keeps asking the same questions
- Output quality isn't improving
- You're getting frustrated

**Why Looping Happens:**
- Original request was unclear
- AI and user have different interpretations
- Task is too complex for current approach
- Revision feedback isn't specific enough

**How to Break the Loop:**

**Step 1: Stop Revising**  
After 3 revision cycles, don't try again—reset instead.

**Step 2: Reset the Task**  
"Let's restart. Here's what I need…"

**Step 3: Give Clearer Instructions**  
- Be more specific about format
- Add constraints (tone, length, structure)
- Break complex tasks into simpler steps
- Use an action verb from the glossary

**Example:**

**Stuck Loop:**  
Request → Output (wrong) → Revision 1 (still wrong) → Revision 2 (still wrong) → Revision 3 (still wrong)

**Break the Loop:**  
"Let's restart. Here's what I need: A 150-word product description with 3 customer benefits in bullet points. Use a professional but friendly tone. Focus only on benefits—ignore features, pricing, and technical specs."

**New Output:** ✅ Correct

**Prevention:**  
- Use clear, specific requests from the start
- Limit revision cycles (2-3 max)
- Reset early if not improving

**See:** Manual 37 (Troubleshooting Guide), Section 4 for reset guidance

---

## **7. LEADERSHIP & OVERSIGHT**

### **7.1 How do leaders maintain alignment?**

**Answer:**  
By referencing the core system documents.

**The 6 Core Documents:**

**1. Manual 21 - Operating Charter**  
**Purpose:** System mission and authority  
**When to Reference:** AI refuses valid tasks or accepts invalid ones

**2. Manual 25 - Safety & Compliance Addendum**  
**Purpose:** 11 restricted domains  
**When to Reference:** AI approaches or crosses boundaries

**3. Manual 26 - Role Definitions & Domains**  
**Purpose:** 5 agent roles and their tasks  
**When to Reference:** Task routing feels wrong

**4. Manual 27 - Interaction Protocol**  
**Purpose:** 8 communication rules  
**When to Reference:** AI communication feels off

**5. Manual 29 - Workflow Map**  
**Purpose:** 8 task patterns  
**When to Reference:** Workflow doesn't match expected pattern

**6. Manual 31 - Quality Assurance Checklist**  
**Purpose:** 8-step pre-delivery quality gate  
**When to Reference:** Evaluating any output before approval

**How Leaders Use These Documents:**

**Daily:** Use QA Checklist on every output (Manual 31)  
**Weekly:** Review task patterns and workflows (Manual 29)  
**Monthly:** Check role performance and routing (Manual 26)  
**Quarterly:** Audit compliance and boundaries (Manual 25)

**When to Correct Alignment:**  
- Output drifts from original request → "Rewrite to match original request."
- Output violates boundaries → Reference Manual 25 → Reset task
- Communication feels off → Reference Manual 27 → Correct protocol
- Quality is declining → Run full QA Checklist → Address gaps

**See:** Manual 40 (Leadership Guide), Section 2.2 for alignment maintenance

---

### **7.2 How often should the system be reviewed?**

**Answer:**  
Follow the 4-cycle maintenance schedule.

**The 4 Maintenance Cycles:**

**Daily Review (5 minutes)**  
- Review active tasks
- Spot any immediate issues
- Ensure tasks are progressing

**Weekly Review (15 minutes)**  
- Review completed tasks for patterns
- Check for recurring issues
- Update templates or standards if needed
- Share learnings with team

**Monthly Review (30 minutes)**  
- Run performance metrics analysis
- Track accuracy, clarity, efficiency, consistency
- Identify declining areas
- Address quality gaps

**Quarterly Review (1-2 hours)**  
- Full system audit
- Update manuals if needed
- Refresh team training
- Review and update boundaries
- Check governance alignment

**What Leaders Should Track:**

**Performance Metrics (6 categories, 1-5 scale):**
1. Accuracy - Does output match request?
2. Clarity - Is content easy to understand?
3. Efficiency - How many revision cycles needed?
4. Consistency - Does output match previous work?
5. Adherence - Does output follow system rules?
6. Completeness - Is everything included?

**Score Trends:**  
- 4.0-5.0 = Excellent performance
- 3.0-3.9 = Acceptable, monitor
- Below 3.0 = Needs intervention

**See:** Manual 33 (Maintenance & Update Schedule) for complete schedule

---

### **7.3 How do leaders correct drift?**

**Answer:**  
Use direct alignment commands.

**The 3 Drift Correction Commands:**

**1. "Stay within the original request."**  
**When to Use:** Output includes content beyond your request.  
**Example:** You asked for product description, got description + pricing + shipping policy.  
**Result:** AI refocuses on original scope.

**2. "Align this with the system rules."**  
**When to Use:** Output violates protocols or boundaries.  
**Example:** AI used overly casual tone when professional was required.  
**Result:** AI corrects to match system standards.

**3. "Follow [specific manual/rule]."**  
**When to Use:** Output violates a documented rule.  
**Example:** "Follow the Interaction Protocol tone standards."  
**Result:** AI adjusts to match documented guidelines.

**Drift Prevention:**

**Define Scope Upfront:**  
"Create a product description. Do not include pricing or technical specs."

**Reference Standards:**  
"Use the professional tone standard from the protocol."

**Set Constraints:**  
"Keep this under 200 words. Focus only on customer benefits."

**Use Templates:**  
"Follow the product description template we approved last week."

**Example Drift Correction:**

**Problem:** Asked for brief email, got 500-word essay with multiple sections.  
**Correction:** "Stay within the original request. I need a brief email, not an essay. Shorten to 150 words and remove all sections."  
**Result:** ✅ Brief, focused email

**See:** Manual 40 (Leadership Guide), Section 2.2 for drift correction

---

## **8. BEST PRACTICES**

### **8.1 Start Simple**

**Principle:** Short, direct requests work best.

**Why:**
- Reduces ambiguity
- Faster processing
- Fewer revision cycles
- Higher quality outputs

**How:**  
Use the instruction formula: **Action Verb + What You Want + Key Details (if needed)**

**Examples:**

✅ **Simple and Effective:**
- "Create a 5-step onboarding checklist."
- "Summarize this report in 3 bullets."
- "Write a 150-word welcome email."

❌ **Too Complex:**
- "Help me think through how we might approach creating some kind of guide or documentation for bringing new people into the organization in a structured way."

**Complexity Progression:**  
Start simple → See what you get → Add details if needed → Build complexity in layers

**See:** Manual 36 (Onboarding Guide), Section 2 for instruction guidance

### **8.2 Build in Layers**

**Principle:** Create complex outputs step-by-step, not all at once.

**The Layer-Building Process:**

**Layer 1: Draft**  
Create first version (expect refinement).  
"Draft a product launch email."

**Layer 2: Refine**  
Make specific improvements.  
"Shorten to 150 words and make tone more urgent."

**Layer 3: Finalize**  
Polish and prepare for use.  
"Add call-to-action button and finalize for distribution."

**Why Layering Works:**
- Maintains control at each stage
- Easier to course-correct early
- AI focuses better on one thing at a time
- Higher final quality

**Example: Building a Sales Page**

**Instead of:** "Create complete sales page with headline, features, benefits, pricing, testimonials, and FAQ."

**Build in Layers:**
1. "Create outline for sales page."
2. "Draft headline and opening paragraph."
3. "List top 5 product features."
4. "Rewrite features as customer benefits."
5. "Add pricing section with 3 tiers."
6. "Assemble into final sales page."

**See:** Manual 40 (Leadership Guide), Section 3.2 for layered building

### **8.3 Use the Glossary Commands**

**Principle:** Tested commands produce predictable results.

**The Essential 14 Commands:**

**Creation:** Draft, Write  
**Organization:** Summarize, Organize into, Create checklist for  
**Optimization:** Rewrite to be clearer, Make more concise  
**Analysis:** Compare, Identify key points  
**Execution:** Assemble into final version  
**Revision:** Expand section  
**Scope Control:** Stay within original request, Focus only on  
**Reset:** Let's restart

**Why Use Glossary Commands:**
- Commands have been tested and refined
- They minimize misunderstanding
- They reduce revision cycles
- They produce consistent quality

**How to Use:**  
Before giving a task, reference Manual 38 (User Command Glossary). Pick the exact command that matches your intent.

**Examples:**
- Instead of: "Make this better" → Use: "Rewrite this to be clearer"
- Instead of: "Do something with this list" → Use: "Organize this into categories"
- Instead of: "I need ideas" → Use: "Generate ideas for [topic]"

**See:** Manual 38 (User Command Glossary) for 70+ commands

### **8.4 Give Feedback**

**Principle:** The system improves with your guidance.

**How to Give Effective Feedback:**

**1. Note Patterns**  
If outputs consistently have the same issue, document it.  
Example: "AI always adds too much detail."

**2. Share With Team/Trainer**  
Report patterns to your team lead or system owner.

**3. Adjust Request Phrasing**  
If something keeps going wrong, rephrase your requests.  
Example: If outputs are always too long, add "Keep this brief" to requests.

**4. Document What Works**  
When you find effective command patterns, share them with your team.

**5. Suggest Improvements**  
If you identify gaps in the system, report them for quarterly review.

**What to Provide Feedback On:**

**Good Feedback:**
- "Tone is consistently too formal for our customer-facing content."
- "Summaries often miss the most important point."
- "Revision command 'Make this more concise' works perfectly."

**Not Helpful Feedback:**
- "The AI is bad."
- "Nothing works."
- "I don't like it."

**Feedback Channels:**
- Team lead (immediate issues)
- Quarterly system review (broader patterns)
- Training sessions (learning opportunities)

**See:** Manual 40 (Leadership Guide), Section 6 for feedback practices
