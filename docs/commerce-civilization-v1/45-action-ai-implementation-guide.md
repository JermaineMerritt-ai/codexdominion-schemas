**Red Flag:** <4.5 average (boundary training critical)

**Completeness:** Includes everything requested?  
**Target:** 4.5+ average  
**Red Flag:** <4.0 average (instruction clarity training needed)

**Scoring Source:** Sample 30-50 outputs across teams

---

**Activity 2: Drift Detection**

**4 Types of Drift (From Manual 33):**

**Tone Drift:**  
Outputs shift from professional to overly casual or overly formal

**Detection:** Compare recent outputs to approved tone examples  
**Correction:** Retraining session using Manual 27 + tone examples

**Scope Drift:**  
Outputs include content beyond original request

**Detection:** QA Checklist Step 3 (Alignment) failing regularly  
**Correction:** Reinforce "Stay within scope" instruction principle

**Quality Drift:**  
Standards slip, outputs require more revisions

**Detection:** Efficiency metrics declining (3+ revisions becoming common)  
**Correction:** Refresher training using Manual 37 (Troubleshooting)

**Boundary Drift:**  
Requests approach or cross restricted domains

**Detection:** Escalations increasing or boundary violations occurring  
**Correction:** Mandatory review of Manual 25 (Safety & Compliance)

---

**Activity 3: Compliance Audit**

**Boundary Adherence Check:**

**Review 11 Restricted Domains (Manual 25):**
1. Strategic business decisions
2. Investment or financial advice
3. Legal advice or contract interpretation
4. Medical diagnoses or health advice
5. Hiring or personnel decisions
6. Personal or sensitive content interpretation
7. Cultural or political judgments
8. Technical support for third-party tools
9. Outcome or result guarantees
10. Identity authentication or verification
11. Financial transaction authorization

**Audit Method:**  
Review 50 recent requests/outputs for any boundary concerns

**Pass Standard:** 0 violations, <5% escalations

**Red Flag:** Any violations require immediate leadership review + team retraining

---

**Activity 4: User Satisfaction Survey**

**Quarterly User Survey (10 questions, 5-10 minutes):**

1. How often do you use Action AI? (Daily / Weekly / Rarely)
2. Overall satisfaction? (1-5 scale)
3. Output quality satisfaction? (1-5 scale)
4. Ease of use? (1-5 scale)
5. Average revisions per task? (1-2 / 3-4 / 5+)

- Outputs don't match expectations
- Require 5+ revisions per task
- Users frustrated with results

**Root Cause:**  
Users not using Action Verb + What + Details formula

**Solutions:**

**Immediate:**
- Share Manual 38 (User Command Glossary) — focus on pages 1-10
- Provide fill-in-the-blank templates (see Step 3.2)
- Show side-by-side examples (vague vs specific)

**Example Comparison:**

**Vague:** "Help me with an email."  
**Specific:** "Draft a 100-word professional email announcing our product launch to customers."

**Long-Term:**
- Include command specificity in Level 1 certification assessment
- Add "instruction clarity" to weekly monitoring
- Recognize users who consistently give clear instructions

---

### **Challenge 2: Outputs Feel Inconsistent**

**Symptoms:**
- Outputs vary widely in tone, format, length

- Team leaders spending excessive time editing

**Root Cause:**  
No standardized workflows, tone examples, or templates

**Solutions:**

**Immediate:**
- Apply QA Checklist (Manual 31) to all outputs before approval
- Create 3-5 approved examples for each use case
- Require tone specification in all requests

**Short-Term:**
- Complete Step 3.2 (Standardize Workflows)
- Define tone profiles with examples (see Step 4.3)
- Create formatting standards document

**Long-Term:**
- Build internal template library
- Conduct monthly consistency audits
- Include consistency in performance metrics

---

### **Challenge 3: Teams Forget Boundaries**

**Symptoms:**
- Requests for strategic recommendations increasing

- Users frustrated by "can't do that" responses

**Root Cause:**  
Insufficient boundary training or drift over time

**Solutions:**

**Immediate:**
- Mandatory review of Manual 25 (Safety & Compliance Addendum)
- Share reframing examples (strategic question → comparison request)
- Reminder about 11 restricted domains

**Example Reframing:**

**Boundary-Crossing:** "Should we expand to Europe or Asia?"  
**Reframed:** "Compare pros and cons of expanding to Europe vs Asia."

**Short-Term:**
- Add boundary quiz to Level 1 certification
- Include boundary adherence in weekly monitoring
- Share escalation examples with teams

**Long-Term:**
- Quarterly boundary training refresher
- Track boundary violations in audits (target: 0)
- Recognize teams with perfect compliance

---

### **Challenge 4: Drift Over Time**

**Symptoms:**
- Quality declining gradually
- Revision cycles increasing
- Tone becoming inconsistent
- Outputs approaching boundaries

**Root Cause:**  
Lack of regular monitoring and maintenance

**Solutions:**

**Immediate:**
- Conduct emergency audit using Step 4.4 process
- Identify specific drift type (tone, scope, quality, boundary)
- Targeted retraining based on drift type

**Drift-Specific Corrections:**

**Tone Drift:** Review Manual 27 + approved tone examples  
**Scope Drift:** Reinforce "Stay within scope" principle  
**Quality Drift:** Refresher on Manual 37 (Troubleshooting)  
**Boundary Drift:** Mandatory Manual 25 review

**Short-Term:**
- Implement Step 3.3 review rhythms (weekly, monthly, quarterly)
- Add drift detection to weekly monitoring
- Create drift correction protocol

**Long-Term:**
- Prevent drift through consistent review rhythms
- Annual recertification for all users
- Quarterly audits as standard practice

---

### **Challenge 5: Over-Reliance on AI**

**Symptoms:**
- Users expect AI to make decisions
- Requests for recommendations increasing
- Frustration when AI can't "just decide"
- Strategic questions directed to system

**Root Cause:**  
Misunderstanding of system purpose (execution vs decision-making)

**Solutions:**

**Immediate:**
- Reinforce core principle: "AI executes, humans decide"
- Share Manual 21 (Operating Charter) — especially purpose section
- Clarify leadership responsibilities (Manual 40)

**Key Messages:**

"Action AI is an execution engine, not a decision-making engine."

"AI provides options, comparisons, and analysis. Humans make judgments, set strategy, and authorize action."

"If you're asking 'Should we…?' or 'Which is better?', reframe as 'Compare these options' or 'What are the pros/cons?'"

**Short-Term:**
- Add "execution vs decision" quiz to Level 1 certification
- Include decision-making reminders in training
- Leadership models appropriate boundaries

**Long-Term:**
- Culture shift: AI as tool, not oracle
- Reinforce in quarterly all-hands meetings
- Celebrate human decision-making + AI execution wins
