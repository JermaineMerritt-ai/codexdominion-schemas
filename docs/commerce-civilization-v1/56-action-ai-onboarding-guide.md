## 2. What the System Does

The system helps with **five kinds of tasks**:

### 1. Creating Content
- Drafts, outlines, emails, descriptions
- Product descriptions, blog post outlines
- Email templates, meeting agendas
- Marketing copy, documentation

**Example Requests:**
- "Draft a short introduction for this product"
- "Create an outline for a blog post about time management"
- "Write a professional email declining a meeting request"

### 2. Organizing Information
- Checklists, summaries, structured sections
- Bullet lists from paragraphs
- Headings and subheadings
- Reorganizing messy content

**Example Requests:**
- "Turn this into a checklist"
- "Organize this into sections with clear headings"
- "Convert these paragraphs into bullet points"

### 3. Improving Writing
- Clarity, tone, conciseness
- Simplifying complex language
- Adjusting formality level
- Removing unnecessary words

**Example Requests:**
- "Make this clearer"
- "Rewrite this in a more professional tone"
- "Shorten this to 100 words"
- "Simplify the language for a general audience"

### 4. Analyzing Information
- Comparisons, insights, key points
- Extracting main ideas
- Identifying patterns
- Highlighting differences

**Example Requests:**
- "Summarize this in five bullet points"
- "What are the key takeaways from this document?"
- "Compare these two approaches"

### 5. Assembling Final Documents
- Clean, polished versions
- Combining sections
- Final formatting
- Ready-to-use deliverables

**Example Requests:**
- "Create a final version from these notes"
- "Combine these sections into one document"
- "Polish this for final delivery"

**If your request fits one of these five categories, the system can handle it.**

---

## 3. What the System Doesn't Do

To keep things **safe and predictable**, the system avoids:

### 1. Legal, Medical, or Financial Advice
- Cannot provide legal opinions or draft contracts
- Cannot offer medical diagnoses or treatment advice
- Cannot give investment recommendations or tax guidance

**Instead, the system can:**
- Help you organize information for your lawyer/doctor/accountant
- Draft general informational content (non-advisory)
- Create templates for professional review

### 2. Interpreting Sensitive Content
- Cannot interpret emotional states or intentions
- Cannot make judgments about personal situations
- Cannot analyze confidential or sensitive material without permission

**Instead, the system can:**
- Organize objective information
- Structure content neutrally
- Format information clearly

### 3. Making Decisions For You
- Cannot choose between strategic options
- Cannot set priorities or goals
- Cannot make policy or planning decisions

**Instead, the system can:**
- Present options clearly
- Organize decision factors
- Structure information for your decision-making

### 4. Emotional or Symbolic Language (Unless You Ask)
- Avoids flowery, poetic, or emotional language by default
- Stays professional and neutral
- Uses clear, direct language

**But if you want it:**
- "Use an inspiring tone"
- "Make this more warm and friendly"
- "Write this with enthusiasm"

### 5. Guessing When Instructions Are Unclear
- Won't assume what you mean
- Won't fill in missing details
- Won't proceed without clarity

**Instead, the system will:**
- Ask one clarifying question
- Wait for your answer
- Proceed once clear

**This keeps everything stable and easy to trust.**

---

## 4. How to Give Instructions

**You don't need special syntax. Just talk normally.**

### Good Examples

**Creating Content:**
- "Draft a short introduction for this product"
- "Write an email thanking a client for their business"
- "Create an outline for a training presentation"

**Organizing Information:**
- "Summarize this in five bullet points"
- "Organize this into sections with headings"
- "Turn this paragraph into a checklist"

**Improving Writing:**
- "Rewrite this to be clearer"
- "Make this more concise"
- "Adjust the tone to be more professional"

**Analyzing Information:**
- "What are the main points in this document?"
- "Compare these two options"
- "Extract the key insights from this report"

**Assembling Documents:**
- "Combine these sections into one document"
- "Create a final polished version"
- "Format this for presentation"

### What Makes Instructions Work Well

**✓ Short and direct**
- "Summarize this in three bullets"
- Better than: "I was wondering if you could possibly help me create a summary that captures the essence of this document but makes it shorter and maybe uses bullet points or something similar..."

**✓ Clear about what you want**
- "Rewrite this in a professional tone"
- Better than: "Fix this"

**✓ Specific about tone or length (when it matters)**
- "Keep it under 100 words"
- "Use a casual, friendly tone"
- "Make this suitable for executives"

**✓ One task at a time**
- "Draft an introduction" (then review)
- "Now add three key benefits" (separate request)
- Better than: "Draft an introduction, add three key benefits, make it professional, keep it short, use bullet points..."

**Short, direct instructions work best.**

---

## 5. What Happens After You Ask

Every task follows the same **simple flow**:

### The 6-Step Process

**Step 1: You Give a Request**
- You provide clear instructions
- Example: "Summarize this document in five bullets"

**Step 2: The System Interprets It**
- Identifies the task type (summary)
- Checks for clarity and boundaries
- Prepares to execute

**Step 3: You Get a Clean Draft**
- The system produces the first version
- Structured, clear, and aligned with your request

**Step 4: You Review It**
- You read the output
- Decide if it meets your needs
- Identify any needed changes

**Step 5: You Ask for Revisions (If Needed)**
- Simple commands: "Shorten this" or "Expand section 2"
- The system revises cleanly
- No loops or confusion

**Step 6: You Approve the Final Version**
- Once satisfied, you're done
- Use the output as needed
- Move to the next task

### Flow Diagram

```
YOU → System → Draft → Review → Revise → Approve
      Interprets  Produces  (your decision)  (if needed)  (done)
```

**This keeps everything predictable.**

## 6. How to Ask for Revisions

If something feels off, you can say:

### Common Revision Commands

**Adjusting Length:**
- "Shorten this"
- "Expand section 2"
- "Make this longer"
- "Cut this to 100 words"

**Improving Clarity:**
- "Make this clearer"
- "Simplify the language"
- "Explain section 3 more clearly"
- "Remove jargon"

**Changing Tone:**
- "Make this more professional"
- "Rewrite in a casual tone"
- "Make this friendlier"
- "Use a more direct tone"

**Adjusting Structure:**
- "Organize this into sections"
- "Turn this into bullet points"
- "Add headings"
- "Remove unnecessary sections"

**Removing Content:**
- "Remove anything unnecessary"
- "Take out the introduction"
- "Delete section 2"
- "Cut the examples"

### How Revisions Work

**The system revises cleanly:**
- Follows your revision command exactly
- Doesn't add new content unless asked
- Doesn't change parts you didn't mention
- Stays focused on what you requested

**The system doesn't loop:**
- You get one clean revision per request
- No back-and-forth confusion
- No drift from original intent
- Predictable results

**You can request multiple revisions:**
- First revision: "Shorten this"
- Second revision: "Now make the tone more professional"
- Third revision: "Add one more example"
- Each request is handled separately and cleanly

---

## 7. When the System Asks Questions

**The system only asks a question when:**

### 1. The Request Is Unclear
- Multiple ways to interpret your request
- Example: "Clean this up" → "Do you want me to clarify the writing or organize the structure?"

### 2. A Detail Is Missing
- Key information needed to complete the task
- Example: "Summarize this" → "How many bullet points would you like?"

### 3. The Task Could Be Interpreted in Multiple Ways
- Could be a summary OR a rewrite
- Could be formal OR casual tone
- Example: "Fix this email" → "Would you like me to rewrite for clarity or adjust the tone?"

### 4. A Boundary Might Be Crossed
- Request touches a restricted domain
- Example: "Draft a legal contract" → "I can't draft legal documents, but I can help you organize information for your lawyer. Would you like an outline instead?"

### Important Rules About Questions

**The system asks only one question:**
- Never multiple questions at once
- Never "Which do you prefer: A, B, or C, and also what tone, and how long?"
- Always focused and specific

**Once you answer, it proceeds:**
- No follow-up questions
- No loops
- Executes immediately based on your answer

**Example Question Flow:**

**User:** "Organize this content"

**System:** "Would you like it organized by topic or by priority?"

**User:** "By topic"

**System:** [Proceeds immediately with topic-based organization]

**The system doesn't ask unnecessary questions:**
- If the request is clear → proceeds without asking
- If the tone is standard → uses professional/neutral
- If the structure is implied → follows standard format

## 8. How to Reset a Task

If things feel tangled or misaligned:

### Reset Phrases That Work Instantly

**"Let's restart. Here's what I need…"**
- Clears all previous context
- Starts completely fresh
- You provide new instructions

**"Rewrite this to match the original request"**
- Returns to the initial instructions
- Ignores all revisions
- Starts over from step one

**"Stay within the original scope"**
- Refocuses on initial task
- Removes any drift or additions
- Returns to core request

**"Ignore the previous revisions"**
- Discards all changes
- Returns to first draft
- Allows fresh revision approach

### When to Reset

**Use a reset when:**
- Revisions have made things worse
- The output drifted from your original request
- You want to try a different approach
- Things feel confusing or tangled
- Multiple revisions created complexity

**Don't overthink resets:**
- They're instant and clean
- No penalty for using them
- Common and expected
- Better than pushing forward when confused

### Reset Example

**Original Request:** "Draft a short product description"

**After several revisions:** Output has become long, complex, and off-target

**You say:** "Let's restart. Draft a short, simple product description in 3 sentences."

**Result:** Clean, fresh start with clear instructions

**A reset clears confusion instantly.**

## 9. Tips for New Users

### Tip 1: Keep Instructions Short
- "Summarize this in three bullets" ✓
- Not: "I need you to read through this document and create a summary that's easy to understand and maybe uses bullet points and captures the main ideas..." ✗

### Tip 2: Be Specific About Tone or Length (If It Matters)
- "Write a casual, friendly email under 100 words" ✓
- "Write an email" (system uses default professional tone) ✓
- Both work—specify when it matters to you

### Tip 3: Break Big Tasks Into Steps
Instead of: "Draft a complete marketing plan with sections for audience, strategy, tactics, timeline, and budget"

Try:
1. "Draft a target audience section for a marketing plan"

3. "Now add three specific tactics"
4. "Create a timeline for these tactics"
5. "Add a budget breakdown"

**Each step is clear and manageable.**

## 10. Common Questions

### "What if I don't know what to ask for?"
Start by describing what you need in plain language. The system will either proceed or ask a clarifying question.

Example:
- You: "I need help with this document"
- System: "Would you like me to summarize it, organize it, or improve the clarity?"
- You: "Organize it"
- System: [Proceeds]

### "What if the output is wrong?"
Request a revision with specific guidance:
- "This is too formal—make it more casual"
- "This missed the main point—focus on customer benefits"
- "This is too long—cut it to 100 words"

Or reset and try again with clearer instructions.

### "Can I use my own writing style?"
The system follows your instructions. If you want a specific style:
- "Write this in a conversational tone like a friend talking"
- "Use short, punchy sentences"
- "Write this like a news article"

### "What if I need something the system can't do?"
The system will tell you clearly:
- "I can't provide legal advice, but I can help you organize your questions for a lawyer"
- "I can't make strategic decisions, but I can present the options clearly for your review"

You'll always know where the boundaries are.

### "How long does each task take?"
Most tasks complete in seconds. The system works fast—you spend more time reviewing than waiting.

### "Can I use this for work projects?"
Yes, that's what it's designed for:
- Business writing
- Documentation
- Content creation
- Organization and analysis
- Communication materials

### "What if I make a mistake in my request?"
No problem:
- Request a revision
- Use a reset phrase
- Start over with new instructions

There's no penalty for adjusting as you go.
