### Best Practices & Compliance

- **Do not commit sensitive manifests to version control.** Add `lineage-manifest-*.json` to your `.gitignore` if these files contain secrets or ephemeral data.
- **Manifest generation is automated in CI/CD workflows.** See `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` for implementation details.
- **For compliance and audit,** refer to `docs/runbooks/compliance/` and `docs/runbooks/lineage/` for further reading and procedures.
